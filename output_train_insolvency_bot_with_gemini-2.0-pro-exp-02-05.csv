Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	"Okay, here's a breakdown of your situation, the potential legal issues, and what steps you should take, referencing the relevant law: **1. Your Current Status and Liability:** * **Shareholder Status:** Signing a stock transfer form is *not* sufficient on its own to transfer shares and remove you from Companies House records. The form needs to be delivered to the company, and the company needs to update its register of members. Then form TM01 needs to be filed to make Companies House aware of the change. It's highly likely you are *still* legally a 5% shareholder. This is critical because, as a shareholder, you have certain (limited) rights and, potentially, liabilities. * **Director Status:** Crucially, being removed as a shareholder doesn't automatically remove you as a director. You mentioned leaving the position ""a couple of months ago."" Did you formally resign as a director? This requires a formal notice of resignation to the company. Even then, the company *must* file Form TM01 with Companies House to update the public record. If Form TM01 wasn't filed, you are, in the eyes of the law and third parties, *still a director*. This is the most dangerous aspect of your situation. * **Director's Duties & Potential Liabilities:** As a director (if Form TM01 wasn't filed), you have significant legal duties to the company, even if you haven't been actively involved. These duties include: * Acting in the company's best interests. * Promoting the success of the company. * Exercising reasonable care, skill, and diligence. * Avoiding conflicts of interest. * A duty not to trade while insolvent, If the company is insolvent (or becomes insolvent), your duties shift primarily to the creditors. If you breach these duties, you can face personal liability for the company's debts, disqualification as a director (under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986), and even fines. The *Bradcrown Ltd, Re* case highlights that even taking legal advice doesn't necessarily protect a director who approves detrimental transactions. * **The Other Director's Actions:** The other director's actions (dropping off the keys and demanding you wind up the company) are highly problematic. They are essentially abandoning their own directorial duties and attempting to foist them onto you. This is a strong indicator of potential misconduct on *their* part. **2. Insolvency Considerations:** * **Is the Company Insolvent?** The other director's note suggests the company is in financial difficulty. You need to determine, as best you can, if the company is insolvent. There are two main tests, as clarified in the cases you provided: * **Cash Flow Test (s.123(1)(e) IA 1986):** Can the company pay its debts as they fall due? *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2)* confirms this includes *future* debts, not just those immediately due. * **Balance Sheet Test (s.123(2) IA 1986):** Are the company's assets less than its liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities? *BNY Corporate Trustee Service Ltd v Eurosail* emphasizes that this is assessed on the balance of probabilities. *Casa Estates* says you apply both tests. If *either* test is met, the company is insolvent. If the company is insolvent and continues to trade, the directors (potentially including you) risk personal liability for wrongful trading. *Byblos Bank v Al-Khudhairy* is also relevant, showing that vague hopes of future funding aren't enough to avoid insolvency. * **Winding up:** It is up to the shareholders of the company to pass a special resolution (75%) to begin the process of winding up. **3. Immediate Steps You MUST Take:** 1. **Do NOT Act as a Director:** Do *not* take any steps to sell assets, pay debts, or otherwise manage the company's affairs *until your status is clarified*. If you act as a director when you're not (or when the company is insolvent), you could increase your personal liability. Sending the keys back by recorded delivery is a good first step to show you're not taking possession of the company's property. 2. **Gather Information:** You urgently need to obtain the following: * **Confirmation from Companies House:** Check the company's filing history online (it's free). See if Form TM01 (to remove you as a director) and the stock transfer form have been filed. * **Company Records:** You have a right, as a shareholder (and potentially still a director), to inspect the company's statutory registers (register of members, register of directors). This will confirm whether the share transfer was processed and whether your directorship was formally terminated internally. You also, ideally, need access to the company's financial records (bank statements, accounts, invoices, etc.) to assess its solvency. * **The stock transfer form:** Do you have a copy? 3. **Formal Written Communication:** Send a formal letter (by recorded delivery and email) to the other director, stating: * You are investigating your status as a director and shareholder, as you believed your resignation and share transfer had been completed. * You are *not* accepting responsibility for managing the company or its winding up. * You require immediate access to the company's records (as listed above) to ascertain its financial position and your own legal status. * You explicitly state that you are not authorizing them to take any actions on your behalf. * You reserve all your legal rights. 4. **Seek Immediate Legal Advice:** This is *absolutely crucial*. You need to speak to a solicitor specializing in insolvency and company law *immediately*. They will: * Review the documents you gather. * Advise you on your exact legal position (director/shareholder status and potential liabilities). * Help you determine if the company is insolvent. * Advise you on the best course of action, which might include: * Negotiating with the other director. * Taking steps to formally resign as a director (if necessary). * Potentially petitioning for the company's winding up (under s.124 IA 1986) as a creditor (if you are owed money) or, in very exceptional circumstances, as a contributory (shareholder) – though this is less likely given your 5% stake and the conditions in s.124(2). *Lancefield v Lancefield* highlights how rare it is for the court to wind up a company on its own motion. * Defending yourself against any potential claims. * Report the director to the Insolvency Service if he has failed in carrying out his duties. 5. **Do NOT touch company assets.** **4. Potential Outcomes and Considerations:** * **If you ARE still a director and the company is insolvent:** Your priority is to minimize your personal liability. This likely means working with a solicitor to try and put the company into a formal insolvency process (like administration or liquidation) as quickly as possible. This protects you from accruing further liability for wrongful trading. * **If you are NOT a director:** You still have rights as a shareholder. You might want to consider your options for recovering any value from your shares (though this is unlikely if the company is insolvent). * **The other director's liability:** The other director is likely in breach of their duties and could face disqualification and personal liability. * **Insolvency Act 1986, Section 234**: If the company enters administration, goes into liquidation or an administrative receiver is appointed, the office-holder can demand that any person hand over company property. The court might compel you to had over company property. **In summary, your situation is precarious. Do not delay in seeking legal advice. Acting without legal guidance could significantly worsen your position.** The key is to establish the facts (your director/shareholder status and the company's solvency) and then act accordingly, with the advice of a solicitor, to protect yourself.

Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	"Okay, I understand this is a very stressful situation. Here's a breakdown of the legal position and potential options, keeping in mind I'm advising as a corporate insolvency lawyer in England: **1. The Core Problem: Breach of Contract and Unpaid Wages** * Your partner's primary legal claim is against ""X,"" the subcontractor who employed him. There is a clear breach of contract because X has not paid your partner for the work done. This is a straightforward employment issue, and X is legally obligated to pay those wages. **2. The Difficulty: X's Potential Insolvency** * The fact that X ""doesn't have the money"" and owes money to Y suggests X may be insolvent, or at least experiencing serious cash flow problems. This makes recovering the £1800 more complicated. * **Notion of Insolvency:** There are two main tests for insolvency under the **Insolvency Act 1986, section 123**: * **Cash Flow Test:** Is the company unable to pay its debts as they fall due? (s.123(1)(e)) This seems likely in X's case. * **Balance Sheet Test:** Are the company's assets less than its liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities? (s.123(2)) This may also be the case, given the debts owed. *Important case law here is *Rowntree Ventures Ltd v Oak Property Partners Ltd* [2016] EWHC 1523 (Ch). **3. Options Against X (The Subcontractor)** * **Demand Letter:** Your partner should send a formal ""letter before action"" (a demand letter) to X. This letter should: * State the amount owed (£1800). * Specify the dates the wages were earned. * Demand payment within a specific timeframe (e.g., 7 days). * Warn that legal action will be taken if payment is not received. * This is a crucial first step, and it's best if this is done in writing (email is acceptable, but recorded delivery is preferable). * If X is a sole trader and not a limited company or a partnership, your partner may commence proceedings in the employment tribunal. * **Statutory Demand:** If X is a limited company and the debt is undisputed and over £750 (which it is), your partner could serve a statutory demand. This is a formal demand for payment under the **Insolvency Act 1986, section 123(1)(a)** (for companies) or **section 222** (for unregistered companies/partnerships). It gives X 21 days to pay, secure the debt, or reach an agreement. Failure to comply with a statutory demand is strong evidence of insolvency and can be grounds for a winding-up petition. * **Important Note:** *Petitioner v Company* [2022] highlights the impact of Coronavirus on insolvency proceedings. However, given the timeline (your partner hasn't been paid for 3 weeks), it's unlikely the *Petitioner v Company* defence (that the financial difficulty was solely due to COVID) would be successful here. The debt arose *after* the main pandemic period. * **Winding-Up Petition:** If X is a limited company and fails to comply with the statutory demand, your partner (as a creditor) could present a winding-up petition to the court under **Insolvency Act 1986, section 124**. This is a serious step that aims to put X into compulsory liquidation. A liquidator would then be appointed to realize X's assets and distribute them to creditors according to a strict order of priority. * **Risk:** If X has few assets, there's a risk that your partner will receive little or nothing after secured creditors (like banks with charges over X's assets) and preferential creditors (like employees for certain wage arrears, but this is capped) are paid. * **Cost:** There are court fees associated with a winding-up petition, and legal costs if you instruct a solicitor. * **County Court Claim:** Your partner could issue a claim in the County Court for the unpaid wages. This is a more straightforward debt recovery action. If successful, your partner would obtain a County Court Judgment (CCJ) against X. Enforcement options for a CCJ include: * **Bailiffs (High Court Enforcement Officers):** They can seize and sell X's assets. * **Attachment of Earnings Order:** If X is employed elsewhere (unlikely, given the situation), money can be deducted directly from their wages. * **Third-Party Debt Order:** If someone owes X money (e.g., Y), that money could be paid directly to your partner. * **ACAS:** Your partner could make a claim to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service for unpaid wages. **4. Options Against Y (The Intermediate Contractor)** * **Very Limited.** Your partner has no direct contract with Y. The principle of **privity of contract** means that only parties to a contract can sue or be sued on it. *MacDonald Dickens & Macklin v Costello* [2011] EWCA Civ 930 is a strong authority on this point. The court in *Costello* refused to bypass the contractual arrangements. Your partner's contract is with X, not Y. * It may be possible for your partner to argue that Y has been unjustly enriched. However, this is a complex area of law, and will be very difficult to do. **5. Options Against the ""Massive UK House Builder""** * **Almost Certainly None.** The same privity of contract issues apply, but even more strongly. There's no direct contractual relationship between your partner and the house builder. * **Reputational Pressure:** Contacting the house builder and explaining the situation *might* exert some pressure on Y (and indirectly on X) if the house builder values its reputation and doesn't want to be associated with subcontractors who don't pay their workers. However, this is *not* a legal remedy, and the house builder has no legal obligation to intervene. It is a commercial consideration, not a legal one. **6. Piercing the Corporate Veil (Extremely Unlikely)** * ""Piercing the corporate veil"" means disregarding the separate legal personality of a company (X Ltd) and holding the directors or shareholders personally liable. This is *very* rare in English law. * **Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22** established the principle of separate legal personality. * **Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34** confirmed that piercing the veil is only possible in cases of *evasion* of existing legal obligations. * **Gilford Motor Co. Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch. 935** is an example of evasion (using a company to avoid a restrictive covenant). * **Gencor ACP Ltd v Dalby [2000] 7 WLUK 805** shows it can be done where a company is a mere facade for the director's personal dealings. * Simply being unable to pay is not a reason to pierce. * Unless X was set up specifically to defraud your partner (which seems highly unlikely based on your description), piercing the veil is not a viable option. **7. Practical Steps and Advice** 1. **Gather Evidence:** Collect all documents related to your partner's employment with X: contracts, payslips (if any), emails, texts, work schedules, etc. 2. **Send the Demand Letter:** This is the essential first step. Be clear, concise, and set a deadline. 3. **Consider a Statutory Demand:** If X is a limited company, this is a powerful tool, but understand the implications. 4. **Seek Further Legal Advice:** While Citizens Advice has a waiting period, consider contacting a solicitor specializing in employment law or insolvency. Many offer a free initial consultation. A solicitor can assess the specific details and advise on the best course of action. 5. **Don't Rely on Y or the House Builder:** Focus your efforts on X, as that's where the legal obligation lies. 6. **Explore Benefits:** Ensure you're claiming all benefits you're entitled to, given your change in circumstances. 7. If X is a sole trader not a limited company or a partnership, consider commencing proceedings in the employment tribunal. 8. Contact ACAS and the Redundancy Payments Service. **In summary,** your partner's best legal recourse is against X. A statutory demand followed by a winding-up petition (if X is a limited company) is a strong option, but carries risks. A County Court claim is a more straightforward debt recovery route. Piercing the corporate veil is highly unlikely. Contacting the main contractor is a commercial, not a legal, strategy. Seeking further professional legal advice is strongly recommended.

Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	Okay, I understand. This is a very complex and stressful situation, and it's completely understandable that you feel overwhelmed. Let's break down the issues, explore your options, and see what can be done. I'll provide legal information and potential strategies, but remember this is general advice, and you *absolutely* need to engage a specialist insolvency lawyer as soon as possible. **Key Issues and Legal Principles** 1. **Cross-Guarantee and the RLS Loan:** The Recovery Loan Scheme (RLS) loan with a cross-guarantee between Company A (trading) and Company B (property) is a major issue. This means Company B is legally obligated to repay the RLS loan if Company A cannot. This is standard practice for such loans. 2. **Intercompany Loan:** The loan from Company A to Company B is an asset of Company A. The liquidator of Company A has a *duty* to realize assets for the benefit of Company A's creditors. This means they *will* pursue repayment of this loan from Company B. 3. **Company B's Solvency:** The core question is whether Company B is *insolvent*. This is determined by two main tests, both of which must be considered, as established in *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383*: * **Cash Flow Test (IA 1986, s.123(1)(e)):** Can Company B pay its debts as they fall due? This includes *current* debts and *future* debts that are reasonably certain to arise (*Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)*). The liquidator's demand for the intercompany loan repayment, the ongoing mortgage payments, and the RLS guarantee call all factor into this. Mere hopes of future funding aren't enough (*Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986)*). * **Balance Sheet Test (IA 1986, s.123(2)):** Are Company B's assets less than its liabilities, *taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities*? The RLS guarantee is a significant contingent liability, and the intercompany loan is a definite liability. The key here is a realistic valuation of the industrial unit. *BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28* confirmed that the balance of probabilities is the standard of proof. 4. **Liquidator's Powers and Duties:** The liquidator of Company A has a duty to maximize returns for creditors. They have extensive powers, including: * Realizing assets (like the intercompany loan). * Investigating the company's affairs. * Potentially challenging past transactions (more on this below). * If they believe Company B is insolvent, they may indeed push for its administration or liquidation to gain control of the industrial unit. 5. **Administration vs. Liquidation:** * **Administration (IA 1986, Schedule B1):** The primary objective is to rescue the company as a going concern. If that's not possible, the administrator aims for a better result for creditors than liquidation. If neither is possible, they realize assets to pay secured or preferential creditors. An administrator has a moratorium, stopping creditor action (IA 1986, s.A16). A move from administration to a creditors' voluntary liquidation can be notified using Companies House Form AM22. * **Liquidation:** This is the end of the company's life. Assets are sold, and proceeds are distributed according to a strict order of priority. A liquidator in a winding-up by the court can be notified using Companies House Form WU04. An appointment of liquidator in a voluntary winding up by the members or creditors can be notified using Companies House Form 600CH. 6. **Director's Duties (Companies Act 2006, s.172):** As a director of both companies, you have duties: * To act in the best interests of *each* company. This becomes incredibly difficult when the companies have conflicting interests, as they do here. * When a company is insolvent or nearing insolvency, the duty shifts to prioritizing the interests of *creditors* (s.172(3)). This is crucial. *HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013]* highlights that directors can be held personally liable for misfeasance (breach of duty) under IA 1986, s.212 if they cause the company to make payments when insolvent. * If Company B is insolvent, continuing to trade and incurring further liabilities could expose you to personal liability. 7. **Potential Challenges:** * **Transactions at an Undervalue (IA 1986, s.238):** If Company A transferred assets (including the loan) to Company B at a value significantly less than their true worth, the liquidator could challenge this. This is *less* likely to be relevant for a genuine loan, but it's a factor to consider. * **Preferences (IA 1986, s.239):** If Company A made payments to Company B (or any other creditor) that put Company B in a better position than it would have been in a liquidation, *and* Company A was influenced by a desire to prefer Company B, the liquidator could challenge this. This is a *major* risk if, for example, Company A repaid part of the intercompany loan recently while neglecting other creditors. * **Wrongful Trading (IA 1986, s.214):** If you, as a director of Company B, knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of Company B avoiding insolvent liquidation, and you continued to trade, you could be personally liable for contributing to the company's assets. * **Director Disqualification:** Under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, you could face disqualification as a director for unfit conduct. **Possible Strategies (Requires Immediate Legal Advice)** 1. **Independent Valuation:** Get an urgent, independent, and *realistic* valuation of the industrial unit. This is the cornerstone of assessing Company B's solvency. 2. **Negotiation with the Liquidator:** Your lawyer should engage with the liquidator of Company A *immediately*. The goal is to explore options: * **Payment Plan:** Can a realistic payment plan for the intercompany loan be agreed upon, taking into account Company B's other liabilities? * **Sale of the Unit:** If Company B *is* insolvent, a controlled sale of the unit might be better than a forced sale in administration/liquidation. You might be able to find a buyer at a better price. * **Scheme of Arrangement:** Under Part 26 of the Companies Act, you could propose a compromise with your creditors. *Re Maxwell Communications Corporation Plc (No 2)* is an example of this in a cross-border situation, but it's complex. 3. **Review of RLS Terms:** Carefully examine the RLS loan agreement and the cross-guarantee. Are there any clauses that could be helpful? (Unlikely, but worth checking). 4. **Consideration of Insolvency Procedures for Company B:** * **Voluntary Administration:** If Company B is insolvent, *you* could appoint an administrator. This gives you some control over the process (compared to a liquidator forcing it) and provides a moratorium. It's a serious step, but it might be the best way to protect the business or achieve a better outcome for creditors. * **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** A CVA (IA 1986, Part I) is a formal proposal to creditors to pay back a percentage of debts over time. This could be an option for Company B, but it requires creditor approval. * **Liquidation:** If rescue is impossible, a creditors' voluntary liquidation (CVL) might be the least worst option. It allows for a more orderly wind-down than a compulsory liquidation. 5. **Reviewing all actions as a director:** It is important to review whether, as a director, you have fulfilled your duties. 6. **Considering Insolvency Act 1986 section 95:** The liquidator must follow the procedures set out in this section. 7. **Consider bringing a petition to wind up the company:** Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 8. **Consider whether company is unable to pay debts:** Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 9. **Determine when a company may be wound up by court:** Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 **Crucial Next Steps** * **Engage a Specialist Insolvency Lawyer:** *Do not delay*. This situation is far too complex to handle without expert legal advice. * **Gather All Documentation:** Loan agreements, financial statements, bank statements, correspondence with the liquidator, property valuations, etc. * **Be Honest and Transparent:** With your lawyer and the liquidator. Hiding information will only make things worse. * **Act Quickly:** The longer you wait, the fewer options you'll have. **Is there any point in carrying on?** Yes, there *is* a point in exploring your options. While the situation is extremely challenging, there *might* be ways to salvage something. It's important to get professional legal advice to assess the situation realistically and determine the best course of action. Don't give up without exploring all possibilities.

Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"Okay, here's some legal advice regarding the scenario where a sole director of multiple LTD companies has personal debts, and the question is whether company assets can be seized to satisfy those debts. **General Principle: Separate Legal Personality** The cornerstone principle, as established in *Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22*, is that a limited company is a separate legal entity distinct from its shareholders and directors. This means: * **Company Debts Stay with the Company:** As you correctly stated, the debts of the LTD company are generally the responsibility of the company itself, not its directors or shareholders personally. * **Personal Debts are Personal:** Conversely, the personal debts of a director, even a sole director, are generally *their* responsibility, not the company's. The company's assets are, in principle, protected from the director's personal creditors. **Exceptions and Complications: When Can Company Assets Be Targeted?** While the principle of separate legal personality is strong, there are circumstances where a court might look beyond it, potentially allowing access to company assets for a director's personal debts. These fall into a few main categories: 1. **Piercing the Corporate Veil** This is the most significant exception. ""Piercing the corporate veil"" means the court disregards the separate legal personality of the company and treats the company and the director as one and the same. However, courts are *very* reluctant to do this. It's only in exceptional circumstances, usually involving: * **Fraud or Improper Conduct:** The director has used the company structure to deliberately evade existing legal obligations or perpetrate fraud. Cases like *Gilford Motor Co. Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch. 935* (where a company was set up to circumvent a restrictive covenant) and *Gencor ACP Ltd v Dalby [2000] 7 WLUK 805* (where the company was essentially a director's ""offshore bank account"") exemplify this. The director in Prest *v Petrodel* was using company assets, and so the assets were held on trust for the husband. * **Sham or Façade:** The company is not a genuine business but merely a ""front"" for the director's personal activities. *FG Films Ltd, In Re [1953] 1 All ER 615* is a good example, where a British company was deemed a mere agent of an American company. * **Single Economic Unit (Rare):** In very limited cases, where a group of companies operates as a single economic entity, the court might treat them as one. *DHN Food Distributors Ltd v Tower Hamlets LBC [1976] 3 All ER 462* is often cited, but this approach is generally not followed today, with *Adams v Cape Industries Plc (1990) BCLC 479* reinforcing the separate legal personality even within groups. *Important Note:* Simply being a sole director and having personal debts is *not* enough to pierce the corporate veil. There must be evidence of abuse of the corporate form. *MacDonald Dickens & Macklin v Costello [2011] EWCA Civ 930* reinforces this. 2. **Director's Loan Account (DLA)** If the director owes money *to* the company (an overdrawn director's loan account), this is an asset of the *company*. The director's personal creditors could potentially seek to access this debt owed *to* the company. This isn't piercing the veil; it's recognizing that the debt is a company asset. 3. **Shares in the Company** The director's *shares* in the company are personal assets. A creditor could obtain a charging order over these shares, potentially leading to a sale of the shares. This doesn't directly seize company *assets*, but it can give the creditor control of the company. 4. **Transactions at an Undervalue or Preferences** If the director has transferred assets from the company to themselves (or a connected person) at less than their true value, or has given a preference to certain creditors (including themselves) before the onset of insolvency, these transactions can be challenged by a liquidator under the Insolvency Act 1986. This would be relevant if the *company* became insolvent. The liquidator could seek to recover those assets for the benefit of the company's creditors. *Re City Build (London) Ltd (in liq.) [2022] EWHC 364 (Ch)* is a case where a transaction at an undervalue was under consideration. 5. **Guarantees and Personal Liabilities** If the director has given a personal guarantee for company debts, or has otherwise become personally liable (e.g., through wrongful trading under the Insolvency Act 1986, or disqualification leading to personal liability under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, section 15, as seen in *PSV 1982 v Langdon [2022] EWCA Civ 1319*), then their personal assets are at risk, but this is due to the *guarantee* or specific legal provision, not simply because they are a director. 6. **De Facto or Shadow Directors** If an individual is not formally a director, but exercises the powers and responsibilities, then the courts will hold that they acted as one. Cases of note include *Kaytech Int’l Plc, Re [1999] B.C.C. 390* and *Re Glam and Tan Ltd [2022] EWHC 855 (Ch)*. **Practical Steps and Advice** 1. **Full Disclosure:** The director should provide full and honest disclosure of their financial situation, including their personal debts and their relationship with the companies. 2. **Legal Advice:** Seek immediate legal advice from a solicitor specializing in insolvency and company law. This is crucial to assess the specific risks and options. 3. **Review Company Operations:** Examine how the company has been operated. Have there been any transactions that could be challenged? Have proper corporate formalities been followed? 4. **Consider Restructuring:** If there are concerns about potential challenges, consider restructuring the company's affairs (with legal advice) to ensure a clear separation between personal and corporate assets. 5. **Insolvency Act 1986**: * **Section 123:** Defines when a company is deemed unable to pay its debts, a key trigger for insolvency proceedings. * **Section 124:** Deals with who can petition for the winding up of a company. * Section 373, deals with jurisdiction of courts. 7. **Companies Act 2006**: * **Section 1187:** Addresses foreign disqualification of directors. **Important Considerations** * The burden of proof is on the creditor to show that the corporate veil should be pierced or that another exception applies. * The courts are generally reluctant to interfere with the principle of separate legal personality. * Each case turns on its specific facts. **In summary, while a director's personal debts are generally separate from their company's assets, there are specific legal mechanisms that could, in exceptional circumstances, allow creditors to access company assets. Seeking professional legal advice is essential to navigate this complex area of law.** "	23.71700644493103	1	Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 section 15|Insolvency Act 1986 section 373 (Individual Insolvency: General Provisions)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Companies Act 2006 section 1187 (Company directors: foreign disqualification etc)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	"Okay, here's some advice based on the information you've provided, and drawing on the legal resources you've listed. It's important to remember I'm providing general guidance based on limited information, and this *isn't* a substitute for specific legal advice tailored to your exact circumstances after a full review of all documents and facts. **Key Issues and Analysis** 1. **The Debt Collection Agency's Claim:** The debt collection agency is acting on behalf of Utility Bidder, claiming you've breached your contract by ending it early. This is a contractual claim. The key question is whether the termination fee they are claiming is a valid and enforceable term of the contract, or whether it might be considered a penalty clause (which is generally unenforceable). This would require a review of your contract with Utility Bidder. 2. **Striking Off Application (DS01) and Objection:** You've applied to strike off your company (Form DS01). The debt collection agency is claiming this will be blocked because of the debt. This is *partially* correct. A creditor *can* object to a striking-off application. If Utility Bidder (or the agency on their behalf) formally objects, Companies House will *not* proceed with the strike-off until the objection is resolved. This is designed to prevent directors from simply dissolving companies to avoid legitimate debts. 3. **Insolvency Practitioner Threat:** The debt collector's suggestion to see an insolvency practitioner (IP) is a common tactic. IPs are expensive, and as you correctly point out, it's disproportionate to spend thousands to deal with a £1,000 debt. The suggestion of a ""payment plan"" is also standard – they want to recover *something*. His suggestion to ""find the money from somewhere"" is inappropriate and borders on harassment. You are not personally liable for this company debt unless you have given a personal guarantee. 4. **Company's Financial Position:** Your company has no money and no assets. Crucially, you've stated that equipment was mostly yours personally, either pre-existing or purchased with personal funds. This is very important. It means these assets are *not* company property and are *not* available to creditors of the company. You used company money for consumables (ingredients) – which is perfectly normal. 5. **Insolvency Tests:** The debt collector's actions are implicitly suggesting your company is insolvent. Let's break down the relevant tests, referring to the cases you cited: * **Cash Flow Test (s.123(1)(e) IA 1986):** Can the company pay its debts as they fall due? Your company *cannot*, as it has no funds. This test is met. *Cheyne Finance* confirms that this includes consideration of future debts, but only those that are certain or highly likely to arise. * **Balance Sheet Test (s.123(2) IA 1986):** Are the company's assets less than its liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities? Your company has no assets, and a £1,000 liability (plus potentially more if other final bills exist). This test is also met. *BNY Corporate Trustee Service Ltd v Eurosail* clarifies that this is assessed on the balance of probabilities. *Casa Estates* confirms both tests must be considered. * Because the company has no assets and cannot pay the debt, both tests of insolvency are likely met. 6. **Winding Up (Liquidation):** Given the company's insolvency, the *correct* formal procedure (if the strike-off is unsuccessful) is likely compulsory liquidation. This is initiated by a creditor (Utility Bidder, most likely) presenting a winding-up petition to the court (s.124 IA 1986). The court, if satisfied the company is insolvent (s.122 IA 1986, specifically s.122(1)(e)), will make a winding-up order. *Byblos Bank* demonstrates that vague hopes of future funding are irrelevant. 7. **Directors Duties:** Although your question does not specifically reference any wrongdoing by you, it is worth noting the following. *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA* established the test that directors do not owe a general duty to creditors, simply because there is a long-term liability on the balance sheet. **Recommended Course of Action (Prioritised)** 1. **Do Nothing (Initially, but Monitor):** Given that you've already applied for striking off, the most pragmatic approach *at this stage* is to wait and see if Utility Bidder objects. Keep a close eye on your Companies House filings (you can set up alerts). Do *not* respond to the debt collector's pressure tactics. *Do not* agree to a payment plan. *Do not* offer personal funds. 2. **Review the Utility Bidder Contract:** Find your contract with Utility Bidder. Look carefully at the termination clauses. Are there early termination fees? Are they clearly defined? If the fee seems disproportionately high compared to Utility Bidder's actual losses from your early termination, it might be an unenforceable penalty clause. This is a complex area of contract law, but worth checking. 3. **Formal Objection Received:** If you receive *formal* notification from Companies House that Utility Bidder has objected to the strike-off, you have a few options: * **Negotiate (with caution):** You *could* try to negotiate a reduced settlement with Utility Bidder. *However*, do this *only* if you believe it's genuinely cheaper and less hassle than the alternative (liquidation). Make it clear any offer is made ""without prejudice"" (meaning it can't be used against you in court) and is a commercial decision to avoid further costs, *not* an admission of liability. * **Defend the Claim (if arguable):** If, after reviewing the contract, you believe the termination fee is a penalty, you could dispute the debt. This would likely involve legal proceedings, and you'd need legal advice. This is probably *not* cost-effective for a £1,000 debt. * **Allow Liquidation:** This is likely the most straightforward, albeit not ideal, outcome. If Utility Bidder objects and you don't settle or successfully defend the claim, they will likely proceed with a winding-up petition. 4. **Winding-Up Petition:** If Utility Bidder presents a winding-up petition, the court will likely grant it, given the company's insolvency. An Official Receiver (OR) will be appointed. The OR will investigate the company's affairs, but since there are no assets and you've acted properly (using personal funds for personal assets), there's unlikely to be any adverse outcome for you *personally*. You would be required to cooperate with the OR, providing information about the company's dealings. 5. **Form LIQ02 (Statement of Affairs):** If the company goes into liquidation, you will be required to complete a Statement of Affairs (Form LIQ02). This will detail the company's (lack of) assets and its liabilities. You'll need to be completely honest and accurate in this form. 6. **Director Disqualification:** While unlikely in your case, given the small scale and lack of any suggestion of wrongdoing, it's important to be aware of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Directors can be disqualified for unfit conduct, but this typically involves more serious breaches of duty, such as fraudulent trading or significant negligence. Simply having an insolvent company is *not* grounds for disqualification. **Important Considerations** * **Personal Liability:** You are *not* personally liable for the company's debts unless you provided a personal guarantee. Do *not* be pressured into paying company debts from your personal funds. * **Shadow Directorship (s.251 CA 2006):** This is unlikely to be relevant in your case, but it's worth noting. If someone else was controlling the company's actions behind the scenes, they could be considered a shadow director and potentially face liabilities. * **Keep Records:** Keep *all* documentation related to the company, the Utility Bidder contract, the striking-off application, and any communications with the debt collector. **In summary, the most likely and probably most sensible outcome is that Utility Bidder will either (a) not bother objecting to the strike-off, in which case the company will be dissolved, or (b) object, leading to compulsory liquidation, which will conclude with the company being dissolved and the debt remaining unpaid because there are no assets.** You are unlikely to face personal repercussions as long as you cooperate with any official processes and have acted honestly. Get specific legal advice if you receive a formal objection or a winding-up petition.

Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	"Okay, here's some legal advice regarding your situation with the creditors' committee, drawing on the provided information and relevant insolvency law: **Understanding the Context and Relevant Legislation** First, it's crucial to establish the *type* of insolvency process the company is undergoing. The rules governing creditors' committees differ depending on whether it's: * **Administration:** Governed by Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act 1986. * **Liquidation (Compulsory or Voluntary):** Governed by the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016. * **Receivership (specifically, Administrative Receivership):** Governed by Part III of the Insolvency Act 1986 (though Administrative Receiverships are now less common). * **Bankruptcy:** Governed by Part IX of the Insolvency Act 1986. * **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** While CVAs don't typically have formal creditors' committees in the same way, the CVA proposal itself might outline mechanisms for creditor consultation and representation. * **Restructuring Plan under Part 26A Companies Act 2006:** This uses a class-based approach, and *Re Smile Telecoms* is very relevant here. However, formal creditors' committees are not a standard feature of this process. You mentioned that the committee was formed ""quickly, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors."" This raises a red flag, as the proper formation of a committee usually involves some form of creditor involvement. **Your Options and How to Proceed** Based on your desire to (1) remove and replace existing members and (2) add new members, here's a breakdown of how you can proceed, *depending on the type of insolvency process*: **1. Identifying the Insolvency Process** You must first be clear what the insolvency process is. For example, liquidation, administration, receivership, or bankrupcy. **2. If it's an Administration or Liquidation:** * **Removal of Existing Members:** * The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, rule 17.8, that you quoted is *highly relevant*. A creditor can be removed by agreement: * If the office-holder (administrator or liquidator) *and* a majority of the *remaining* creditor members agree. * And the total number of creditor members does not fall below three. * A creditor can also resign (Rule 17.9). * A creditor's membership is automatically terminated in certain situations (Rule 17.10), such as if they cease to be a creditor or their debt is transferred to someone who doesn't consent to be a member. * **Replacement of Members:** * Rule 17.8 also covers adding new members. A new member can be appointed if: * A majority of the remaining creditor members agree; *and* * The creditor agrees to act. * **Adding New Members:** * This is also covered under rule 17.8. * **Practical Steps:** 1. **Gather Support:** You'll need to persuade a majority of the *remaining* committee members (and potentially the office-holder, depending on the removal mechanism) to agree to your proposed changes. This means building a coalition of creditors who share your concerns. 2. **Formal Request:** Once you have sufficient support, formally request the changes in writing to the office-holder and the committee. 3. **Companies House Form COM2:** Use this form to notify Companies House of any changes to the committee's membership. This is a legal requirement. **3. If it's an Administrative Receivership:** * **Section 49 of the Insolvency Act 1986** is relevant. The Act allows unsecured creditors to establish a committee. However, the Act provides less specific guidance on changing membership compared to the rules for administration and liquidation. * The committee itself may have internal rules or procedures governing membership changes. Review any documents related to the committee's formation. * If changes are not clearly defined, you'll likely need to negotiate with the administrative receiver and other committee members to agree on a process for removal, replacement, and addition. * The administrative receiver is under a duty to act in good faith and for a proper purpose. **4. If it's Bankruptcy:** * **Section 301 of the Insolvency Act 1986** is relevant. The rules are relevant to the creditors' committee. * The official receiver will not establish a committee. **5. If it's a Restructuring Plan (Part 26A Companies Act 2006):** * This scenario is less likely to involve a formal ""creditors' committee"" in the traditional sense. The focus is on classes of creditors, as seen in *Re Smile Telecoms*. * If a committee-like structure *does* exist, it would likely be governed by the terms of the restructuring plan itself. Review the plan documents carefully. * Your ability to influence the process would primarily be through engaging with the company and other creditors *within your class* to challenge or propose modifications to the plan (before sanction). **6. Challenging the Committee's Actions (General Points):** * **Office-Holder Oversight:** Regardless of the insolvency process, the office-holder (administrator, liquidator, administrative receiver) has a duty to act in the best interests of the creditors *as a whole*. If you believe the committee is acting against those interests, you can raise your concerns with the office-holder. * **Court Application:** As a last resort, if you have evidence that the committee (or the office-holder) is acting improperly, you could consider applying to the court. However, this is a significant step and should only be taken with legal advice. The court has broad powers to give directions in insolvency proceedings. * **Removal of Administrator:** Refer to *St George’s Property Services (London) Ltd (in admin.), Re*. **Important Considerations:** * **""Best Interests of Creditors"":** Your concerns about the committee not acting in the best interests of creditors are crucial. You'll need to gather evidence to support this claim. This could include: * Specific decisions made by the committee that appear to favor certain creditors over others. * Lack of transparency or communication from the committee. * Evidence of conflicts of interest among committee members. * **Legal Advice:** This is a complex area of law. I strongly recommend that you consult with a qualified insolvency lawyer to discuss your specific situation and get tailored advice. They can help you: * Determine the precise type of insolvency process. * Review relevant documents (e.g., the committee's terms of reference, the insolvency practitioner's reports). * Assess the strength of your case for challenging the committee. * Navigate the legal procedures for removing, replacing, or adding members. * Consider alternative strategies, such as applying to the court. **In summary, the process for changing the composition of a creditors' committee depends heavily on the type of insolvency. You have options, primarily through leveraging the Insolvency Rules (for administration and liquidation), negotiating with the office-holder and other creditors, and, as a last resort, potentially seeking court intervention. Gather evidence, build support among other creditors, and seek professional legal advice to navigate this process effectively.** "	21.713650703430176	1	The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 17.8 (CREDITORS' AND LIQUIDATION COMMITTEE)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 301 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 49 (Receivership)	Re Smile Telecoms SA [2022] EWHC 740 (Ch) (Business restructuring; Classes of creditors; Debt restructuring; Discretion; Expert evidence; Foreign companies; Cross-border insolvency; Opposition; Schemes of arrangement)|St George’s Property Services (London) Ltd (in admin.), Re [2011] EWCA Civ858 (Administration; Administrators; Administrators' powers and duties; Extortionate credit transactions; Removal; Replacement administrators; Unsecured creditors)|Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.)

Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	"Okay, here's a breakdown of your situation and advice, drawing on the legal points you've provided and relevant insolvency law: **Analysis of Your Situation** 1. **Limited Company:** Your company is a limited company (""ltd""), meaning the liability of the shareholders is limited, likely to the amount unpaid on their shares (Companies Act 2006, section 3). 2. **Solvent (Mostly):** You state you have ""no debt,"" no overdrawn director's loan accounts, and can pay all VAT and Corporation Tax. This strongly suggests you are *currently* solvent on a cash-flow basis (can pay debts as they fall due) and possibly on a balance-sheet basis (assets exceed liabilities). 3. **The Telecoms Contract:** This is the crucial issue. The 7-year remaining contract represents a *contingent and prospective liability*. The key question is whether the cost of terminating this contract would render the company insolvent. 4. **One Director Leaving:** The departure of a director/shareholder, in itself, doesn't trigger insolvency. However, you state this would make the business unable to continue, which has significant implications (see below). 5. **Cessation of Business:** If the business cannot continue, this raises the question of whether a winding-up is appropriate. **Key Legal Considerations and Advice** * **1. Determining Insolvency:** * **Cash-Flow Test (s.123(1)(e) IA 1986):** Can the company pay its debts *as they fall due*? Right now, it seems you can. *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2)* confirms that this includes considering *future* debts. The telecoms contract payments will become due in the future. * **Balance-Sheet Test (s.123(2) IA 1986):** Are the company's assets less than its liabilities, *taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities*? This is where the telecoms contract is critical. *BNY Corporate Trustee Service Ltd v Eurosail* emphasizes the ""balance of probabilities"" standard for assessing these liabilities. You need to calculate the likely cost of terminating the contract (even if the provider is ""unreasonable,"" there will be a legally quantifiable cost, possibly including damages for breach of contract). * **Casa Estates** held that Cash Flow and blance sheet tests were to be used at the same time. * You must realistically assess the termination cost. If this cost, *added* to any other liabilities, exceeds the company's assets, you would be balance-sheet insolvent. * **Byblos Bank** highlighted that speculative future funding is not considered an asset when calculating the solvency. * **2. Options and Procedures:** * **(a) Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL):** If, after calculating the telecoms termination cost, the company is *still* solvent (assets exceed all liabilities, including that cost), then a Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL) is the appropriate route. * **Process:** The directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency, stating the company can pay its debts in full (including the telecoms liability) within 12 months. A liquidator is appointed by the shareholders to wind up the company's affairs, realize assets, and distribute proceeds to creditors and then shareholders. * **Advantages:** This is a relatively straightforward process for solvent companies. It allows for an orderly winding-up. * **Form AA02:** If the company becomes dormant before liquidation, consider filing Form AA02 for dormant company accounts. * **(b) Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** If, after calculating the telecoms termination cost, the company is *insolvent* (assets are less than liabilities), then a Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) is likely necessary. * **Process:** The directors convene meetings of shareholders and creditors. The shareholders resolve to wind up the company, and the creditors nominate a liquidator. The liquidator's primary duty is to the *creditors*, not the shareholders. * **Implications:** This acknowledges the company cannot pay its debts. The liquidator will investigate the company's affairs and the directors' conduct. * **(c) Compulsory Liquidation (Winding-Up by the Court):** This is less likely in your scenario, but it's an option if, for example, the telecoms company were to petition the court for a winding-up order (under s.122 and s.124 IA 1986) because you are unable to pay the termination costs (and they meet the £750 threshold under s.123(1)(a)). This is generally a more complex and costly process. * **3. Director's Duties and Potential Risks:** * **Duty to Creditors (BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA):** While your company may be solvent *now*, the directors' duties shift towards considering the interests of creditors *when the company is insolvent or bordering on insolvency, or an insolvent liquidation is probable*. Because the departure of the other director makes the business unviable, an insolvent liquidation is probable, if the telecoms debt cannot be paid. * **Wrongful Trading (s.214 IA 1986):** If the company continues to trade while insolvent, and the directors *knew or ought to have concluded* that there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation, they could be liable for wrongful trading. This could lead to personal liability for the company's debts. Given that ceasing trading seems inevitable, continuing to trade while insolvent is very risky. * **Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986:** Liquidators must subit a report to the Insolvency Service, on director conduct. * **4. Resignation of Director** * The outgoing director can be removed by an oridinary resolution of the shareholders, or if permitted by the articles of association, by the other directors. * **Form TM01:** Use this to notify Companies House of the director's termination. **Steps You Should Take Immediately** 1. **Quantify the Telecoms Liability:** Obtain a *precise* figure for the cost of terminating the contract. This may involve negotiation or seeking legal advice on the contract's terms. Don't rely on the telecoms company's initial position; get independent advice. 2. **Prepare a Statement of Assets and Liabilities:** Create a detailed, up-to-date statement of the company's assets and liabilities, including the *quantified* telecoms liability. 3. **Seek Professional Advice:** Consult with a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP) *immediately*. They can: * Assess your solvency position definitively. * Advise on the most appropriate winding-up procedure (MVL or CVL). * Help you navigate the legal requirements and minimize risks. * Negotiate with the telecoms company. 4. **Do Not Continue Trading if Insolvent:** If the IP confirms insolvency, cease trading to avoid potential wrongful trading liability. **Important Note:** Even if the telecoms company is being ""unreasonable,"" that doesn't change the legal position. The contract is a liability, and its cost must be factored into your solvency assessment. The IP can help you negotiate the best possible outcome, but you cannot simply ignore it. **In summary:** You likely *will* need a liquidator, either for an MVL (if solvent after accounting for the telecoms liability) or a CVL (if insolvent). The crucial first step is to accurately determine the cost of terminating the telecoms contract and then seek professional insolvency advice. Ignoring the problem will likely worsen the situation and could expose the directors to personal liability.

Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	Okay, here's a breakdown of your situation, the potential legal arguments, and what you should do, from the perspective of a corporate insolvency lawyer in England: **The Core Problem: Strict Contractual Interpretation** The fundamental issue is that lease agreements, particularly commercial leases, are interpreted *strictly*. The break clause is a contractual right, and the notice period is a condition precedent to exercising that right. By missing the deadline by 7 days, you have *prima facie* failed to comply with the contract. The landlord is, on the face of it, correct that you are bound for the remaining two years. This isn't directly an insolvency issue *yet*, but it could become one if the extra two years of rent significantly impacts your company's financial viability. **Potential Arguments and Strategies (and their Weaknesses)** Here's a breakdown of possible arguments, ranked roughly from strongest to weakest, and why they may or may not be successful: 1. **Negotiation and Agreement (The Best Option):** * **Strategy:** This is your *primary* and most crucial strategy. Forget legal battles for now. Focus on negotiation. Emphasize the prior discussions, the viewings the landlord arranged, and the fact that you've only missed the deadline by a small margin. Offer something in return for the landlord's agreement to accept the late notice. This could include: * Paying a slightly higher rent for the remaining notice period. * Offering to actively assist in finding a new tenant. * Offering a lump sum payment (smaller than the remaining two years' rent) as compensation. * Agreeing to a shorter notice period if a suitable replacement tenant is found quickly. * **Why it's the best:** Litigation is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. A negotiated solution is almost always preferable. The landlord *already knows* you want to leave and has taken steps based on that. This gives you leverage. 2. **Estoppel (A Long Shot, but Potentially Relevant):** * **Strategy:** Estoppel is a legal principle that prevents someone from going back on their word (or conduct) if another party has relied on that word/conduct to their detriment. You would argue that the landlord's prior discussions and arranging viewings created a clear impression that they accepted your intention to break the lease, and you relied on that impression to your detriment (by not pursuing other options or ensuring the formal notice was served *exactly* on time). * **Why it's a long shot:** Estoppel is hard to prove. You need: * A clear and unambiguous representation by the landlord (their actions might be ambiguous). * Reliance by you on that representation (you still had a duty to serve the notice correctly). * Detriment suffered by you as a result of that reliance (the 7-day delay is your own error). * **Case Law Relevance:** While not directly on point, the concept of unfair prejudice in cases like *Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v PRG Powerhouse Ltd* and *Lazari Properties 2 Ltd v New Look Retailers Ltd* shows the court's willingness to consider equitable principles. However, those cases relate to CVAs and the balance of interests between creditors, which is different from your situation. Estoppel is closer to your needs. You'd need to find cases on estoppel in the context of lease agreements and break clauses. 3. **Waiver (Similar to Estoppel, but Equally Difficult):** * **Strategy:** Argue that the landlord, through their conduct (discussions and viewings), *waived* their right to insist on strict compliance with the notice period. Waiver is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right. * **Why it's difficult:** The landlord will almost certainly argue that they never explicitly waived the notice requirement. Informal discussions are unlikely to be enough to constitute a clear waiver of a formal contractual term. 4. **Rectification of common mistake** * **Strategy:** Argue that the contract doesn't match the common intention of both the landlord and the tenant. This will be very difficult to prove. * **Why it's a long shot:** You will have to provide evidence for example emails or meeting notes to make this claim. **Why Insolvency Law Is Relevant (But Not Directly Applicable Yet)** The cases you cited primarily deal with situations where a company is already insolvent or facing imminent insolvency, leading to formal insolvency procedures like Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs). * **BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA:** This case is about directors' duties to creditors when a company is nearing insolvency. It's not relevant to your current situation unless the two years' rent would push your company into a zone of potential insolvency. If that *were* the case, your directors would have a heightened duty to consider the interests of creditors (including the landlord), but that doesn't automatically invalidate the lease terms. * **Lazari Properties 2 Ltd v New Look Retailers Ltd & Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v PRG Powerhouse Ltd:** These cases deal with CVAs, a formal insolvency procedure where a company proposes an arrangement with its creditors to avoid liquidation. A CVA could be a *future* option if you cannot negotiate with the landlord and the rent liability makes the company insolvent, but it's a drastic step and not relevant at this stage. A CVA allows a company to compromise debts, but it requires creditor approval and court sanction. The landlord would be a key creditor. **Immediate Steps You Should Take** 1. **Document Everything:** Gather all emails, letters, notes of phone calls, and records of meetings relating to the lease, the break clause, and your discussions with the landlord. This is crucial for any negotiation or legal argument. 2. **Formal Written Communication:** Send a formal letter (recorded delivery) to the landlord, acknowledging the missed deadline, expressing regret, reiterating your previous discussions, and proposing a solution (e.g., a compromise on the notice period or a payment). This shows good faith. 3. **Seek Immediate Legal Advice:** While I've provided a general overview, you *must* consult with a solicitor specializing in commercial property and landlord-tenant disputes. They can review your specific lease, assess the strength of any estoppel or waiver arguments, and advise on the best negotiation strategy. Do this *before* engaging in further detailed discussions with the landlord. 4. **Financial Assessment:** Honestly assess your company's financial position. Can you afford the two years' rent if the landlord is unyielding? If not, you need to start considering contingency plans, and your solicitor can advise on those (including potential insolvency options, but hopefully avoiding them). 5. **Consider Mediation:** If direct negotiation fails, suggest mediation to the landlord. A neutral mediator can help facilitate a resolution. **Important Considerations** * **Mitigation of Loss:** The landlord has a duty to mitigate their loss. This means they must take reasonable steps to find a new tenant. If they find a new tenant quickly, your liability for the remaining rent would be reduced. * **Forfeiture:** If you stop paying rent, the landlord could potentially forfeit the lease (terminate it) and sue you for damages. This is a complex area, and your solicitor will advise you on the risks. * **Directors' Duties:** If the rent liability *does* threaten the company's solvency, your directors need to be mindful of their duties under the Companies Act 2006 (as highlighted in *Sequana*). They must act in the best interests of the company, which may include considering the interests of creditors. **In summary, your immediate priority is negotiation. Legal arguments like estoppel and waiver are possible but difficult. Seeking expert legal advice is crucial. Don't panic, but act quickly and professionally.** 	26.106468677520752	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 266 (Derivative claims and proceedings by members)|Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)	BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Lazari Properties 2 Ltd v New Look Retailers Ltd [2021] EWHC 1209 (Classes of creditors; Company voluntary arrangements; Coronavirus; Debt restructuring; Equal treatment; Landlords' rights; Material irregularity)|Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v PRG Powerhouse Ltd [2007] EWHC 1002 (Ch) (Company voluntary arrangements; Unfairly prejudicial conduct)	Companies House Form AM05: Use this form to give notice of extension of time to seek approval of the administrator's proposals.|Companies House Form AM19: Use this form to give notice of the extension of period of administration.|Companies House Form AM21: Use this form to give notice of the end of administration.
Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	"Okay, here's a breakdown of the situation and advice based on the information you've provided, incorporating relevant legal principles and practical steps: **1. Assessment of the Situation** It's clear your company is facing significant financial difficulties, and you're right, this is a common scenario post-COVID. The key issues are: * **Insolvency:** The company appears to be both cash-flow insolvent (unable to pay debts as they fall due) and potentially balance-sheet insolvent (liabilities exceeding assets, especially when considering the lease car obligations). This is crucial because it triggers certain director duties and potential liabilities. Under s123 Insolvency Act 1986, the company's inability to pay its debts is defined under two tests. The Cash Flow test states 'if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due.' And the Balance Sheet test states that 'A company is also deemed unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.' * **Director's Guarantees:** The overdraft (OD) has a director's guarantee, making you and the other director *personally* liable for that £6,000. This is separate from the company's debts. * **Lease Cars:** The fact that the lease cars are in the company's name and *appear* to have no director guarantees is positive. However, a thorough review of the lease agreements is essential. Sometimes guarantees are buried in the fine print, or there might be early termination penalties that are substantial. * **Bounce Back Loan (BBL):** The BBL is a company debt, not a personal one. However, how the BBL funds were used is critical (see below). * **Outstanding Invoices:** The £7,000 in outstanding invoices represents a liability the company cannot currently meet. * **Trading History:** The good trading history may be useful in exploring all options. **2. Director's Duties – The Critical Point** Once a company is insolvent, or even *approaching* insolvency, the directors' duties shift. Instead of primarily owing duties to the shareholders (to maximize profits), the directors' primary duty becomes to the *creditors* (to minimize their losses). This is a fundamental principle of insolvency law, highlighted in cases like *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA*. * **Section 172 Companies Act 2006:** This section codifies the duty to promote the success of the company. However, when insolvent, this duty is interpreted as acting in the best interests of the creditors as a whole. * **Wrongful Trading (s.214 Insolvency Act 1986):** This is a serious risk. If you continue to trade while knowing the company is insolvent (or ought to have known) and you don't take *every step* with a view to minimizing potential loss to the company's creditors, you could be held personally liable for the company's debts that accrue during that period. The key here is ""every step"" – simply hoping things will improve isn't enough. * **Fraudulent Trading (s.213 Insolvency Act 1986):** This is even more serious and involves an element of dishonesty (intent to defraud creditors). This carries potential criminal penalties. * **Misfeasance (s.212 Insolvency Act 1986):** This relates to breaches of fiduciary duty. If, for example, you used the BBL for personal expenses rather than legitimate company purposes, this could be misfeasance, leading to personal liability. * **Transactions at an Undervalue (s.238 Insolvency Act 1986) and Preferences (s.239 Insolvency Act 1986):** If you sell assets for less than they are worth, or if you pay off one creditor in preference to others (e.g., paying off a supplier you have a personal relationship with while leaving others unpaid) in the period leading up to insolvency, these transactions can be challenged and reversed by a liquidator. **3. Options and Advice** Given the situation, here are the realistic options, along with legal considerations: * **A. Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** This is likely the most appropriate and common route. * **Process:** The directors resolve that the company cannot continue to trade and call a meeting of shareholders to pass a resolution for voluntary winding up. A licensed insolvency practitioner (IP) is appointed as liquidator. The liquidator's job is to realize the company's assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors according to the statutory order of priority. * **Advantages:** * It's a controlled process (to a degree). You choose the IP (although they have a duty to act in the creditors' interests, not yours). * It minimizes the risk of wrongful trading claims, as you're taking proactive steps to cease trading and protect creditors. * It deals with the company's debts in an orderly fashion. * The BBL is an unsecured debt and will be dealt with in the liquidation. * **Disadvantages:** * The company ceases to exist. * The directors' conduct will be investigated by the liquidator (this is standard). * You will be personally liable for the OD due to the guarantee. * The liquidator is under a legal duty to investigate the directors' conduct and submit a report to the Insolvency Service; the directors could be disqualified as a result if there is evidence of misconduct. * **Legal Considerations:** This process is governed by the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016. * **B. Compulsory Liquidation:** This is initiated by a creditor (or potentially HMRC) petitioning the court for a winding-up order. * **Process:** A creditor (owed more than £750 – see s.123(1)(a) Insolvency Act 1986) serves a statutory demand. If the debt isn't paid within 21 days, they can petition the court. The court, if satisfied the company is insolvent, will make a winding-up order, and an Official Receiver (a government official) will initially become liquidator. * **Advantages:** None from your perspective. This is a less controlled process. * **Disadvantages:** * You lose control of the process. * It's more likely to lead to a more aggressive investigation of the directors' conduct. * It can be more damaging to your reputation. * **Legal Considerations:** Governed by the Insolvency Act 1986 (sections 122, 123, 124). * **C. Administration:** This is generally used for companies that have a viable underlying business but are facing temporary financial difficulties. It provides a moratorium (breathing space) from creditor action while an administrator (an IP) tries to rescue the company as a going concern. Given your statement that the business is ""no longer viable,"" this is highly unlikely to be a suitable option. * **D. Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** This is a formal agreement with creditors to pay a percentage of the debts over time. It requires a viable business plan and the support of 75% (by value) of the creditors. Given the lack of cash flow and the drying up of the customer base, this is also unlikely to be feasible. * **E. Sale of the Business (as a going concern):** This is *very* unlikely given the current circumstances. To sell a business as a going concern, it needs to be, well, *going*. The fact that you've closed the retail store and are struggling with cash flow makes a sale highly improbable. Even if you found a buyer, the price would likely be very low, and it wouldn't solve the underlying insolvency issues. Any sale would need to be at a fair market value to avoid being challenged as a transaction at an undervalue. * **F. ""SpongeBob"" Plan (Dissolution with Asset Distribution):** * This is a plan that involves dissolving the company when there are limited assets and no likelihood of a distribution. * It is high risk and it is recommended that advice from an insolvency practitioner is sought before using this plan. **4. Immediate Steps** 1. **Cease Trading (Probably):** Continuing to trade while insolvent is the biggest risk. You need to make a formal decision, documented in board minutes, about whether to cease trading immediately. Given your assessment of non-viability, ceasing trading is almost certainly the correct course of action. 2. **Consult with an Insolvency Practitioner (IP):** This is *essential* and should be done *before* your meeting with your accountant. While your accountant can provide financial advice, they are not qualified to give insolvency advice. An IP will: * Assess the company's financial position in detail. * Advise on the best course of action (most likely a CVL). * Explain the implications for you as directors. * Help you minimize your personal exposure. * Take over communication with creditors. 3. **Gather Information:** The IP will need: * Full details of all assets and liabilities (including the lease car agreements). * Bank statements. * Details of the BBL (how much, when received, how used). * Copies of any contracts, guarantees, etc. * Management accounts. * Details of any recent asset sales or payments to creditors. 4. **Review Lease Agreements:** Carefully examine the lease car agreements for any personal guarantees or early termination clauses. 5. **Consider Personal Finances:** You need to plan for how you will cover the £6,000 OD. The sale of assets might cover this, but you need a realistic valuation. 6. **Do not pay any creditors preferentially.** All creditors must be treated on an equal footing or this could be classed as a preference payment s.239 IA 1986. **5. Key Legal Principles Reinforced** * **Limited Liability (Salomon v Salomon):** Normally, shareholders are shielded from company debts. However, director actions (wrongful trading, misfeasance, etc.) can pierce this veil. * **Piercing the Corporate Veil:** While rare, courts can disregard the separate legal personality of the company in cases of fraud or improper conduct (e.g., *Gilford Motor Co v Horne*, *Prest v Petrodel*). This is less likely in your case, *provided* you act properly now. * **Good Faith (Belmont Park):** Acting in good faith is important, but it's not a complete defense to wrongful trading. You must actively protect creditors' interests. * **Director Disqualification:** If the liquidator finds evidence of unfit conduct, they can report this to the Insolvency Service, which could lead to disqualification proceedings under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 (as seen in *Kaytech Int’l Plc, Re*). **6. Companies House Forms** You won't need to use forms AP01, AP02, or CH02 at this stage. These are for appointing or changing director details. In a liquidation, the liquidator takes control, and the company will eventually be dissolved. Companies Act 2006 S.154 and S.155 relate to the legal requirement to have at least one director at a company. **Disclaimer:** This is general legal information, not specific legal advice. You *must* consult with a licensed insolvency practitioner immediately. They will be able to advise you based on the specific facts and documents of your case. This situation is serious, and acting quickly and correctly is crucial to protect yourself.

Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	"Okay, let's break down this situation and provide some advice. It's understandable that you're terrified, but getting informed and taking proactive steps is crucial. I'll address your concerns, explain the legal context, and suggest a course of action. **Key Issues and Legal Analysis** 1. **Illegal Dividends (and Director's Loan Account Overdrawn):** This is the most immediate and serious issue. The £35,000 in ""illegal dividends"" likely means that these payments were made when the company did not have sufficient distributable profits to cover them. This is a breach of directors' duties and can have severe consequences. The key case here, as you noted, is *McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch)*. This case highlights that drawings in *anticipation* of profits can be misfeasance and a breach of fiduciary duty if there's no reasonable basis for that anticipation. The liquidator will almost certainly scrutinise these payments. Another similar, relevant case is *Re Glam and Tan Ltd [2022] EWHC 855 (Ch)*, where a director was held personally liable for unlawful dividends. 2. **Director's Fiduciary Duties:** As a director, you have a range of fiduciary duties, including: * **Duty to act in the best interests of the company (s.172 Companies Act 2006):** When a company is solvent, this generally means acting in the interests of the shareholders. However, as the company approaches insolvency, the interests of creditors become increasingly important. The landmark case here is *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25*. The Supreme Court confirmed that the duty to consider creditors' interests arises when the directors *know or ought to know* that the company is insolvent, bordering on insolvency, or that insolvent liquidation/administration is *probable*. The earlier High Court decision, *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)*, is also relevant as it clarifies that the duty isn't triggered simply by a long-term risk, but by a more immediate financial problem. * **Duty to exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence (s.174 Companies Act 2006):** This includes ensuring proper accounting records are kept and that the company complies with its legal obligations. * **Duty to promote the success of the company (CA 2006 s172).** * **Duty to exercise independent judgment (CA 2006 s173).** * **Duty to avoid conflicts of interest (CA 2006 s174).** * **Duty not to accept benefits from third parties (CA 2006 s176).** * **Duty to declare interest in proposed transaction or arrangement (CA 2006 s177).** 3. **Potential for Misfeasance Claim (s.212 Insolvency Act 1986):** If the company goes into liquidation, the liquidator has a duty to investigate the company's affairs and the conduct of its directors. Section 212 allows the liquidator to bring a claim against a director for misfeasance (breach of duty) to recover funds for the benefit of creditors. The illegal dividends are a prime example of conduct that could lead to a misfeasance claim. 4. **Potential for Wrongful Trading (s.214 Insolvency Act 1986):** This is a serious concern. If you continued to trade the company when you knew, or *ought to have known*, that there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation, you could be held personally liable for the company's debts incurred during that period. *Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch)* clarifies that the test is whether there was ""no reasonable prospect of avoiding"" liquidation, and hindsight shouldn't be used to judge the director's actions. *Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733* also demonstrates that directors who act diligently and on proper advice may avoid liability. The key is whether you took every step you reasonably could to minimise potential losses to creditors. 5. **Potential for Fraudulent Trading (s.213 Insolvency Act 1986):** This is even more serious than wrongful trading and involves *intent* to defraud creditors. *Morris v Bank of India [2004] EWHC 528 (Ch)* highlights that liability under s.213 can extend beyond the company's own directors. While less likely on the facts you've presented, it's important to be aware of it. 6. **Director Disqualification:** The liquidator (or the Secretary of State) can apply to have you disqualified from acting as a director for a period of 2 to 15 years. This is based on ""unfit conduct,"" which could include breaches of duty, wrongful trading, or even serious incompetence. *Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477* established that the primary purpose of disqualification is to protect the public. *Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch)* shows that even serious incompetence, without dishonesty, can lead to disqualification. 7. **Insolvency:** The court can make a winding-up order: *Insolvency Act 1986 section 124*. A company is deemed unable to pay its debts: *Insolvency Act 1986 section 123*. 8. **Accounts:** A company's annual accounts must be approved by the board of directors and signed on behalf of the board by a director of the company: *Companies Act 2006 section 414*. Notes to the accounts: *Companies Act 2006 section 472*. Accounts give a true and fair view: *Companies Act 2006 section 393*. **Immediate Steps and Advice** 1. **Seek Independent Legal Advice *Immediately*:** You've already spoken to a liquidator, which is good, but you need your *own* solicitor who specializes in insolvency and directors' duties. They will act solely in *your* best interests, not those of the company or its creditors. This is absolutely critical. Do not delay on this. 2. **Gather All Information:** Assemble all company records, including: * Financial statements (even if incomplete or inaccurate) * Bank statements * Invoices and receipts * Contracts * Correspondence with your previous accountants * Any board minutes or records of decisions * Details of any loans or guarantees you've provided * Details of your personal tax liabilities 3. **Full and Frank Disclosure:** Be completely honest with your solicitor. Withholding information will only harm your case. Explain everything, even if it's embarrassing or potentially damaging. Your solicitor needs the full picture to advise you properly. 4. **Assess the Company's Viability (Realistically):** Your solicitor will help you determine whether the company has any realistic chance of trading out of its difficulties. Given the level of debt and the issues with the accounts, this seems unlikely, but it's essential to have a clear-eyed assessment. 5. **Consider Options:** Your solicitor will discuss various options, which may include: * **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** A CVA is a formal agreement with creditors to repay a portion of the company's debts over time. This is only viable if the company has a realistic prospect of future profitability. Given the illegal dividends and potential misfeasance claims, a CVA is probably not feasible. * **Administration:** An administrator is appointed to take control of the company and try to rescue it as a going concern, sell the business, or achieve a better result for creditors than liquidation. This might be an option to try and salvage some value from the equipment and cash, but it's a complex process. * **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** This is where the directors and shareholders resolve to wind up the company voluntarily. It's often the most appropriate option when the company is clearly insolvent and there's no realistic prospect of recovery. By initiating the process yourself, you have more control over the appointment of the liquidator (though creditors can still object). You should ask your solicitor about using **Companies House Form 600CH** to notify Companies House of the appointment of a liquidator. * **Compulsory Liquidation:** If you don't take action, a creditor (likely HMRC, given the tax liabilities) could petition the court to wind up the company. This gives you less control over the process. 6. **Negotiating with the Liquidator:** Once a liquidator is appointed (either through CVL or compulsory liquidation), your solicitor can negotiate with them. This is crucial to try and mitigate your personal liability. Possible arguments include: * **Arguing against Wrongful Trading:** If you can demonstrate that you took reasonable steps to minimize losses to creditors, even after you realized the company was in trouble, you may be able to reduce or avoid wrongful trading liability. This requires strong evidence. * **Negotiating a Settlement on the Illegal Dividends:** The liquidator will likely demand repayment of the £35,000. Your solicitor can try to negotiate a payment plan or a reduced settlement, based on your personal financial circumstances. It's highly unlikely you'll avoid repaying *something*, but negotiation is key. * **Addressing Director Disqualification:** While disqualification is a separate issue, your cooperation with the liquidator can potentially influence the length of any disqualification period. 7. **Personal Bankruptcy Considerations:** The liquidator's warning about personal bankruptcy is serious. If you can't reach a settlement with the liquidator and/or you have significant personal tax debts, bankruptcy may be unavoidable. However, your solicitor can advise you on the implications of bankruptcy and explore alternatives, such as an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA). 8. **Statement of Affairs (Companies House Form LIQ02):** If the company goes into liquidation, you will likely be required to provide a statement of affairs, outlining the company's assets, liabilities, and financial position. Be truthful and complete in this statement. This form is very important. 9. **Moratorium (Companies House Form MT03):** A moratorium provides temporary protection from creditor action, but it's unlikely to be relevant in this situation given the existing financial problems and the illegal dividends. **Regarding your previous accountants:** * **Professional Negligence:** You may have a claim against your previous accountants for professional negligence if their poor advice or actions contributed to the current situation. Your new accountants should be able to advise you on this. However, pursuing this claim might be complex and costly, and success is not guaranteed. It's worth exploring, but don't rely on it as a solution to your immediate problems. **In summary, the situation is serious, but not hopeless.** Taking immediate action to get independent legal advice is the most important thing you can do. Be prepared for a difficult process, but with the right legal support, you can navigate this and minimize the damage to your future prospects. Do not delay in contacting a solicitor.

Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	"Okay, here's some legal advice regarding your question about TUPE, specifically in the context of a butcher shop going into administration and a new butcher potentially taking over the premises. **The Core Question: Does TUPE apply *just* because a new business of the same type takes over the premises of a defunct one?** The short answer is: **Not automatically, but it's *possible* depending on the specific circumstances.** It's a common misconception that simply moving into the same premises triggers TUPE. The reality is more nuanced. **TUPE: The Basics** The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE), as amended by the Collective Redundancies and Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (Amendment) Regulations 2014, protect employees' rights when the business or undertaking they work for transfers to a new employer. This can happen in two main ways: 1. **Business Transfer:** This is the classic scenario where a business (or part of a business) is sold as a going concern. Assets, goodwill, and customers typically transfer. 2. **Service Provision Change (SPC):** This is where TUPE gets tricky in your scenario. An SPC occurs when: * Activities cease to be carried out by a contractor on a client's behalf and are carried out instead by another person (""a subsequent contractor"") on the client's behalf. * Activities cease to be carried out by a contractor or a subsequent contractor on a client's behalf (whether or not in connection with a contract) and are carried out instead by the client on his own behalf. * A client contracts out services to a contractor. **Why Simply Taking Over Premises Isn't Enough (Usually)** For TUPE to apply, there needs to be a *transfer of an economic entity that retains its identity*. This means more than just the premises changing hands. The ""economic entity"" is defined as ""an organised grouping of resources which has the objective of pursuing an economic activity, whether or not that activity is central or ancillary."" In your butcher shop example, if the new butcher *only* takes over the lease of the premises and nothing else (no stock, no equipment, no customer list, no goodwill, no employees), it's highly unlikely TUPE would apply. This is because there's no transfer of an ""economic entity."" The new butcher is essentially starting a fresh business in an empty shop, albeit one that used to be a butcher shop. **When TUPE *Might* Apply in This Scenario** TUPE *could* apply if, in addition to taking over the premises, the new butcher also acquires: * **Significant Assets:** This could include equipment (saws, refrigerators, display cases), stock (meat, even if it's a small initial amount), or even things like specialized recipes. * **Goodwill:** This is harder to define, but it could include taking over the old butcher's customer list, using a similar name, or benefiting from the reputation of the previous business. * **Employees:** Even if the new butcher doesn't formally agree to take on the old employees, if they end up hiring a significant number of them shortly after opening, it could be argued that there was an *implicit* transfer. The employees must be an ""organised grouping"". * **The business restarts very soon after the closure.** A short gap between closure and reopening strengthens the argument for continuity. **Key Case Law** * **Spijkers v Gebroeders Benedik Abattoir CV [1986] ECR 1119:** This is a foundational case that established the ""economic entity"" test. The court looks at all factors to determine if the business retains its identity after the transfer. * **Various cases on Service Provision Changes:** These cases have refined the SPC rules, and are relevant if, say the old butchers, had an external contract. **The Administration Factor** The fact that the old butcher shop went into administration adds a layer of complexity. * **Administrators' Duties:** The administrators of the old butcher shop have a duty to act in the best interests of the creditors (under a duty of care, as in *Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2), Re [1990] B.C.C. 605*). They might try to sell the business as a going concern (including the lease, assets, and goodwill), which would make a TUPE transfer more likely. If they just sell off the assets piecemeal, it would make a TUPE transfer very unlikely. * **Pre-pack Administration:** If the new butcher is lined up before the administration (a ""pre-pack"" sale), TUPE is much more likely to apply. This is because the business is effectively being sold as a going concern, even though it goes through a formal insolvency process. * Insolvency Act 1986: This would be the primary piece of legislation governing the Administration. **The Employees' Position** The employees of the old butcher shop are in a vulnerable position. * **If TUPE applies:** Their employment contracts (including terms and conditions, length of service, etc.) automatically transfer to the new butcher. They cannot be dismissed simply because of the transfer (though they could be dismissed for other legitimate reasons). * **If TUPE does *not* apply:** Their employment ended when the old butcher shop entered administration (or when it ceased trading, if that happened earlier). They would have claims against the old company (likely in the administration) for things like unpaid wages, holiday pay, and redundancy pay. These claims would be subject to the rules of distribution of assets in an insolvency, and they may not receive everything they are owed. The rules from *SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7* would be important, particularly if any of the employees were also directors or had some other debt to the company. * *Metro Nominees (Wandsworth) (No 1) Ltd v Rayment [2008] B.C.C. 40*: if a new butcher takes the lease, but an old lease still exists, then this case could be relevant to any dispute. **Practical Advice for the Employees** 1. **Seek Legal Advice:** The employees should seek urgent legal advice from a solicitor specializing in employment law and insolvency. 2. **Gather Information:** They should gather as much information as possible about the closure of the old butcher shop and the opening of the new one. This includes any communication from the administrators, any offers of employment from the new butcher, and any details about the transfer of assets. 3. **Register as Creditors:** They should register as creditors in the administration of the old butcher shop. 4. **Redundancy Payments Office** They may be able to recover some money. **Practical Advice for the New Butcher** 1. **Due Diligence:** Before taking over the premises, the new butcher should conduct thorough due diligence to assess the risk of a TUPE transfer. This includes investigating what assets are being acquired, whether any former employees will be hired, and the circumstances of the old butcher shop's closure. 2. **Legal Advice:** The new butcher should seek legal advice from a solicitor specializing in employment law and business acquisitions. 3. **Structure the Deal Carefully:** If the new butcher wants to minimize the risk of TUPE, they should structure the deal as an asset purchase (premises only) and avoid taking on any other elements that could suggest a transfer of an economic entity. 4. **Consider Indemnities**: The new butcher should require an indemnity in case it is subject to unexpected liabilities. **In summary,** the situation you describe is a grey area. Whether TUPE applies will depend on a careful analysis of all the facts. It's not simply a matter of the new butcher taking over the same premises. It is absolutely essential for both the employees and the potential new business owner to take legal advice.

Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	"Okay, I understand the situation. It's a very difficult position to be in, and it's clear you've been working hard to try and save the business. Here's a breakdown of the legal position, your options, and some practical advice, based on the information you've provided and my expertise as a corporate insolvency lawyer in England: **1. The Core Issue: Inability to Pay Debts** Your company is insolvent. It cannot pay its debts as they fall due, and its liabilities (including the Bounce Back Loan) exceed its assets. This is the fundamental legal trigger for various insolvency procedures. Specifically, Section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986 defines this inability to pay debts: * **s.123(1)(e):** ""...if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due."" This is the ""cash flow"" test. * **s.123(2):** ""A company is also deemed unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities."" This is the ""balance sheet"" test. Your situation satisfies both of these tests. **2. Options for Closing the Company** Given the insolvency, there are primarily two routes: * **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** This is the most common route for insolvent companies. The directors (you) acknowledge the company's insolvency and, with the agreement of the shareholders, appoint a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP) as liquidator. The liquidator's job is to realize the company's assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors according to a strict statutory order of priority. *However*, you've stated you have no funds to pay for a liquidator. This makes a CVL difficult, though not entirely impossible (see below). * **Compulsory Liquidation (Winding-Up by the Court):** A creditor (in this case, potentially HSBC) can petition the court to wind up the company. The court, if satisfied that the company is insolvent (under s.122 and s.123 of the Insolvency Act 1986), will make a winding-up order. The Official Receiver (a government official) initially becomes the liquidator, and an IP may be appointed later. HSBC has indicated they are unlikely to take this route for a £12,000 debt, as it's often not cost-effective for them. * **Dissolution (Strike-Off):** This is *not* a formal insolvency process, but it's relevant to your situation. You can apply to Companies House to have the company struck off the register. However, this is only appropriate if the company has *no* outstanding liabilities (or very minimal ones that you are certain will not be pursued). Crucially, you *must* inform all creditors, including HSBC, of your intention to strike off the company. If a creditor objects (and HSBC almost certainly would, given the outstanding loan), the strike-off will be suspended. **3. The Bounce Back Loan (BBL) and HSBC's Position** * **Government Guarantee:** The BBL is guaranteed by the government, but this guarantee is to the *lender* (HSBC), not the borrower (your company). If your company defaults and cannot repay, HSBC can claim under the guarantee. This doesn't absolve your company of the debt, but it shifts the immediate risk to the government. * **HSBC's ""Long-Term No Affordability"" Approach:** This suggests HSBC is taking a pragmatic view. They recognize pursuing the debt aggressively may be futile. They are likely prioritizing their relationship with the government and recovering under the guarantee. * **Personal Liability:** A crucial point is that, *generally*, directors are not personally liable for company debts due to the principle of limited liability. However, there are exceptions: * **Wrongful Trading (s.214 Insolvency Act 1986):** If, before the company went into insolvent liquidation, you knew or ought to have concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation, and you continued to trade, you could be held liable for contributing to the company's assets. However, based on your description (taking the BBL for product development and stock, not personal use, and actively trying to save the business), wrongful trading seems unlikely. The case of *Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch)* is relevant here, emphasizing that hindsight should not be used to judge directors' decisions. * **Misfeasance (s.212 Insolvency Act 1986):** This involves a breach of duty by a director that causes loss to the company. Again, based on your description, this seems unlikely. The funds were used for legitimate business purposes. *McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch)* provides an example of misfeasance, but your situation is different. * **Transactions at an Undervalue (s.238 Insolvency Act 1986):** If you had transferred company assets for significantly less than their value, this could be challenged. This doesn't seem applicable. *Pathania v Tashie-Lewis [2021] EWHC 526 (Ch)* highlights the need for clear evidence of fraudulent intent in such cases. * **Preference (s.239 Insolvency Act 1986):** If you had preferred one creditor over another (e.g., paid off a personal loan while leaving the BBL unpaid) in the period leading up to insolvency, this could be challenged. * **Personal Guarantees:** if you have given any Personal guarantees, you may be liable. * **Director Disqualification:** Although unlikely to make you personally liable for the debt, the Insolvency Service *could* investigate your conduct as a director. If they find serious misconduct, you could be disqualified from being a director for a period of time. Cases like *Re Pure Zanzibar Ltd [2022] EWHC 971 (Ch)* and *Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch)* illustrate the types of conduct that can lead to disqualification. *Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477* emphasizes the public protection aspect of director disqualification. However, based on your description of events, significant misconduct leading to disqualification seems improbable. **4. The ""Limbo"" Scenario and Companies House Strike-Off** You ask if the company will be ""left in limbo"" and eventually struck off by Companies House. This is a *possible* outcome, but it's *not* guaranteed and carries risks: * **Companies House Action:** Companies House *can* initiate strike-off action if a company fails to file its annual returns or appears to be inactive. However, this is a slow process, and creditors can object. * **Creditor Objection:** As mentioned, HSBC is highly likely to object to any strike-off application you make while the BBL remains unpaid. They will want to keep the company ""alive"" to pursue their claim, even if it's primarily through the government guarantee. * **Risk of Restoration:** Even if the company *is* struck off, HSBC (or any other creditor) could apply to have it restored to the register to pursue the debt. This can happen even years later. **Companies House Form RT01** is used for this purpose. **5. Recommended Course of Action: Proactive Engagement and Potential ""Bargain"" CVL** Given the above, here's the most legally sound and practical approach: 1. **Formal Communication with HSBC:** Continue the open communication. Formally write to HSBC, stating: * The company is insolvent and unable to repay the BBL. * You have no funds to pay for a CVL. * You understand their position regarding the government guarantee. * You are seeking their guidance on the best way to proceed. 2. **Explore a ""Bargain"" CVL:** Even though you lack funds, it's worth contacting a few licensed insolvency practitioners (IPs). Explain the situation. Some IPs might be willing to take on a CVL with minimal upfront costs, particularly if: * They believe they can recover *some* assets (even if minimal) to cover their fees. * They see the BBL claim against the government guarantee as a relatively straightforward process. * They are willing to work with HSBC to streamline the process. This is often called a ""light touch"" or ""bargain"" CVL. It's not guaranteed, but it's worth exploring. It provides a cleaner, more formal closure than the uncertain ""limbo"" scenario. 3. **If a CVL is Impossible:** If no IP will take on the case, your next best option is to wait and see if HSBC petitions for compulsory liquidation. This is, as you've been told, unlikely. In the meantime: * **Cease Trading Immediately:** Do not incur any further debts. * **Preserve Records:** Keep all company records meticulously. This is crucial if there's any future investigation. * **Do NOT Attempt Strike-Off:** Do not apply for strike-off without HSBC's explicit written consent. 4. **Consider the Creditor Duty:** Although your actions suggest you have been acting in good faith, remember that as directors of an insolvent company, your duties shift from primarily serving the shareholders' interests to considering the creditors' interests. *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25* clarifies this ""creditor duty."" While it doesn't automatically make you liable for the debt, it's a factor to keep in mind. **6. Addressing Your Feelings** It's completely understandable to feel hurt and heartbroken. Starting and running a business is a huge undertaking, and its failure is often deeply personal. However, from a legal perspective, it's important to separate your personal feelings from the company's legal position. You took reasonable steps to try and save the business, and the current economic climate is a major factor beyond your control. **In Summary** The best course of action is to continue engaging with HSBC and explore the possibility of a ""bargain"" CVL. This provides the most controlled and legally sound closure. If that's not possible, wait for HSBC's next move, cease trading, preserve records, and do *not* attempt to strike off the company without HSBC's consent. While personal liability is unlikely based on your description, it's crucial to act responsibly and transparently throughout this process. Seek professional advice from a licensed insolvency practitioner as soon as possible. They can provide tailored guidance based on a full review of your company's financial records.

Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	"Okay, here's some legal advice regarding your situation, broken down into key areas and drawing on the relevant law you've provided, plus some additional crucial points about partnership law: **I. Understanding the Nature of Your Problem** This situation isn't primarily about corporate insolvency (despite my expertise!), because you're operating as a *general partnership*, not a limited company. This is a crucial distinction. The principles of *Salomon v Salomon* (separate legal personality) and piercing the corporate veil *do not directly apply*. Partnerships have different rules and liabilities. **Key Differences between Partnerships and Limited Companies:** * **Liability:** In a general partnership, partners have *unlimited joint and several liability*. This means you are *personally* liable for *all* the debts of the partnership, even those caused by your partner's actions. This is the opposite of the limited liability enjoyed by shareholders in a company, as established in *Salomon v Salomon*. * **Legal Personality:** A partnership is *not* a separate legal entity from the partners. It's a relationship, not a distinct ""person"" in the eyes of the law. This contrasts sharply with a company, which is a separate legal person. * **Formation:** Partnerships are often formed informally, even without a written agreement (though yours thankfully has one). Companies have strict formation requirements. **II. Your Partner's Actions: Breach of Partnership Agreement and Fiduciary Duty** Your partner's actions constitute serious breaches of both your partnership agreement and their fundamental fiduciary duties as a partner: * **Breach of Partnership Agreement:** You state the agreement has terms regarding cash handling, record-keeping, and banking. The £3,000 shortfall and consistent failure to follow procedures are clear breaches. This gives you grounds for action under the agreement itself. * **Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** Partners owe each other the utmost good faith and honesty. This is a fundamental principle of partnership law, akin to the fiduciary duties owed by company directors (as seen in cases like *Gencor ACP Ltd v Dalby* relating to secret profits, and *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA* concerning the duty to act in good faith). Your partner's actions – essentially taking money without proper accounting – are a severe breach of this duty. They have acted in their own self-interest, to the detriment of the partnership and you. This is analogous to a director using a company as their ""offshore bank account,"" as in *Gencor*. * **The apology letter** The apology is strong supporting evidence. **III. Options for Ending the Partnership** You are correct that expelling your partner in a two-person partnership will likely lead to dissolution. Here's a breakdown of your options: 1. **Expulsion (if the agreement allows):** * **Check the Agreement:** Carefully review the expulsion clauses. Do they specify the grounds for expulsion (which should include breaches of the agreement and fiduciary duty)? Do they outline a specific procedure (e.g., notice period, opportunity to respond)? You *must* follow the procedure precisely. Failure to do so could lead to a claim for wrongful expulsion. * **Consequences:** If the expulsion is valid, the partnership will likely dissolve. The agreement should also specify what happens upon dissolution, including the distribution of assets and liabilities. The lack of entitlement to goodwill following explusion that is mentioned in your partnership deed is an important point. * **Risk:** Even with a valid expulsion, your partner might still try to claim they are entitled to something (e.g., a share of the ""goodwill,"" even if the agreement tries to exclude it). 2. **Dissolution by Notice (if the agreement allows, or if it's a ""partnership at will""):** * **Partnership at Will:** If your partnership agreement doesn't specify a fixed term or a specific method for dissolution, it's likely a ""partnership at will."" This means either partner can dissolve it at any time by giving notice to the other. * **Agreement Provisions:** If the agreement *does* have provisions for dissolution by notice, follow them precisely. * **Consequences:** Similar to expulsion, this leads to the winding up of the partnership. 3. **Negotiated Dissolution:** * **Best Option (Ideally):** Despite the emotional blackmail, try to negotiate a *written* agreement for the dissolution. This agreement should cover: * The date of dissolution. * How assets (stock, equipment, cash) will be valued and divided. * How liabilities (debts, outstanding invoices) will be handled. * Who will be responsible for winding up the business (e.g., notifying suppliers, customers, HMRC). * The repayment of the £3,000 (this is crucial – treat it as a debt owed to the partnership). * Ownership of the business name, intellectual property, and customer list (see below). * A release of all claims against each other (to prevent future disputes). * **Mediation:** If direct negotiation is impossible, consider using a mediator to help you reach an agreement. 4. **Application to Court (Last Resort):** * **Insolvency Act 1986, s.122(1)(g):** While primarily for companies, the principle of ""just and equitable winding up"" can, in exceptional circumstances, be applied to partnerships. This is similar to the situation in *Lancefield v Lancefield*. If your partner refuses to cooperate and the situation is irretrievably broken down, you could apply to the court for an order to wind up the partnership. This is a costly and time-consuming option, but it may be necessary if you can't reach an agreement. The grounds would be that the relationship of trust and confidence has completely broken down, making it just and equitable to dissolve the partnership. * **Insolvency Act 1986, s.124 and s.123:** These sections are more relevant to companies, but they highlight the general principles of insolvency. If the partnership is genuinely unable to pay its debts, this could be a factor in a court application. However, your primary issue isn't insolvency, but the breach of trust and the desire to end the partnership. **IV. Taking Over the Business Alone** * **Valuation:** You'll need to agree on a fair valuation of the partnership assets. This might require an independent valuation, especially if you disagree. * **Buying Out:** You may need to ""buy out"" your partner's share of the assets. This could be a lump sum or payments over time. The £3,000 should be factored into this calculation – it reduces the amount your partner is entitled to. * **Goodwill:** This is the intangible value of the business (reputation, customer relationships, etc.). Your partnership agreement's clause about no entitlement to goodwill upon expulsion is *very* important. If the expulsion is valid, this clause strengthens your position. However, even with such a clause, there might be arguments about the *value* of the goodwill. If the business has significant goodwill, your partner might still try to claim a share, arguing the clause is unfair. * **Business Name and Intellectual Property:** If you want to continue using the same business name and any associated branding (logos, etc.), this needs to be explicitly addressed in the dissolution agreement. Ideally, you'd want your partner to assign all rights in the name and IP to you. If the partnership agreement doesn't cover this, and you can't agree, there could be a dispute. You might have to argue that you developed the name/IP, or that it's so closely associated with you that your partner's continued use would cause confusion. * **Setting up a new business:** Once your partnership is ended a new business will need to be set up. This will depend on your preference, but the most popular choice would be a sole tradership or a limited company. **V. Practical Steps and Reassurance** 1. **Gather Evidence:** Keep *all* records: bank statements, cash records, the partnership agreement, your partner's apology letter, emails, and any other relevant documents. 2. **Formal Notice:** If you decide to expel or dissolve by notice, do it *in writing* and keep a copy. Refer specifically to the relevant clauses of the partnership agreement. 3. **Seek Professional Advice:** This response provides general guidance, but you *must* consult with a solicitor who specializes in partnership disputes. They can review your specific agreement, advise on the best course of action, and draft the necessary legal documents. 4. **HMRC:** You'll need to inform HMRC about the dissolution of the partnership and sort out the final tax return. 5. **Bank:** Notify your bank about the change in the business structure. 6. **Suppliers and Customers:** Inform them appropriately, depending on whether you're continuing the business or closing it down. **Reassurance:** You are not being taken for a mug. You've acted responsibly by identifying the problem and seeking to address it. Your partner's actions are a serious breach of trust, and you are entitled to take steps to protect yourself and your financial interests. While the emotional aspect is difficult, focus on the legal and practical steps you need to take. The law provides mechanisms to resolve partnership disputes, and a solicitor can guide you through the process. It's important to remember that you are not liable for the actions of your partner.

Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	"Okay, here's some advice regarding your situation, drawing on the legal principles and resources you've provided. It's important to note that this is general advice, and a full consultation with an insolvency practitioner (IP) is strongly recommended. **Understanding Your Situation and Options** You're describing a situation where your limited company is ceasing operations and has insufficient assets to cover all its liabilities. You, as a director, are concerned about how to distribute the remaining funds and the potential consequences. There are a few key points to consider: * **Limited Liability:** As established in *Salomon v Salomon & Co.*, a limited company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders (you and your wife). This generally means you are not personally liable for the company's debts, *except* in specific circumstances (see below). * **Insolvency:** Your company appears to be insolvent, as it cannot pay its debts as they fall due (Insolvency Act 1986, s.123(1)(e)). It may also be insolvent on a balance sheet basis (s.123(2)), meaning its liabilities exceed its assets. * **Directors duties**: You have various duties toward your creditors (as established in common law), to act in their best interests. * **Winding Up Options:** There are two main options for winding up an insolvent company: * **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** This is initiated by the company's directors and shareholders. You pass a resolution to wind up the company and appoint a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP) as liquidator. The liquidator takes control of the company, realises its assets, and distributes them to creditors according to a statutory order of priority. * **Compulsory Liquidation:** This is initiated by a creditor (or in some cases, the company itself or the Secretary of State) petitioning the court for a winding-up order (Insolvency Act 1986, s.122 and s.124). The court appoints an Official Receiver, who may then appoint an IP as liquidator. **Addressing Your Immediate Concerns** 1. **Prioritising the £600:** You cannot simply choose which creditors to pay. If you were to pay some creditors in preference to others, this could be considered a ""preference"" under the Insolvency Act 1986, and a liquidator could later seek to recover those payments. The proper course of action when a company is insolvent is to cease trading and seek professional advice about formal insolvency. An insolvency process will mean the assets will be sold and the returns distributed according to statutory law. 2. **Distribution in insolvency:** The statutory order of priority dictates the manner of which assets are distributed, this is as follows: 1. Fixed charge creditors. 2. Expenses of the liquidation/administration. 3. Preferential creditors (certain employee claims). 4. Prescribed part ring-fenced fund for unsecured creditors. 5. Floating charge creditors. 6. Unsecured creditors (this would include your energy, water, and broadband providers). 7. Shareholders. 3. **Consequences of Unpaid Debts:** Since your company is insolvent, the remaining creditors (energy, water, broadband) will likely be unsecured creditors. They will receive a dividend (a proportion of their debt) only if there are sufficient funds after paying higher-priority creditors. It's highly likely they will not receive full payment. 4. **Director's Loan:** The director's loan you mention is an interesting point. If you've put money *into* the company, that's a loan *from* you *to* the company. In an insolvency, you would rank as an unsecured creditor for that loan, *after* the other unsecured creditors like the utility companies. If the company has lent money *to* you (a director's loan account overdrawn), the liquidator will seek to recover that money from you personally, as it's an asset of the company. 5. **Landlord:** Although the landlord has been ""okay"" about the unpaid rent, that does not remove their ability to recover from the business by statutory order. **Recommended Steps** 1. **Cease Trading Immediately:** You've already done this, which is crucial. Continuing to trade while knowingly insolvent can lead to personal liability for wrongful trading. 2. **Seek Professional Advice:** Contact a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP) *immediately*. They can: * Assess your company's financial position fully. * Explain the winding-up options (CVL vs. compulsory liquidation) in detail. * Advise you on your duties and potential liabilities as a director. * Help you communicate with creditors. * If appropriate, act as the liquidator. 3. **Do Not Pay Any Creditors:** Avoid making any further payments from the company's account until you've spoken to an IP. 4. **Consider a CVL:** Given your situation, a Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) is likely the most appropriate route. It gives you more control over the process than compulsory liquidation. The IP will handle the realization of assets and distribution to creditors. 5. **Striking Off (DS01) is NOT Appropriate:** You mentioned Companies House Form DS01. This is for *solvent* companies that wish to be struck off the register. Using this form when your company is insolvent is a serious offense and can lead to significant penalties, including personal liability for the company's debts, disqualification as a director, and even prosecution. **Potential Risks and Considerations** * **Wrongful Trading:** If you continue to trade while knowing the company is insolvent and worsen the position of creditors, you could be held personally liable for the company's debts incurred during that period (Insolvency Act 1986, s.214). * **Preferences:** As mentioned, paying some creditors in preference to others can be challenged by a liquidator. * **Transactions at an Undervalue:** If you've sold any company assets for less than their true value, a liquidator could seek to overturn those transactions. * **Misfeasance:** If you've breached any of your duties as a director (e.g., failing to act in the best interests of creditors), a liquidator could pursue you for compensation. * **Disqualification:** The Secretary of State can disqualify you from acting as a director for a period of up to 15 years if your conduct is deemed unfit (*Kaytech Int’l Plc, Re*). **Piercing the Corporate Veil - Less Likely in Your Case** The cases you cited on piercing the corporate veil (*Prest*, *MacDonald Dickens & Macklin*, *Gilford Motor Co.*, *Adams v Cape*, *Gencor*, *FG Films*, *DHN Food Distributors*) are generally relevant in situations involving fraud, sham structures, or deliberate evasion of legal obligations. While it's essential to be aware of these principles, they are less likely to apply in your situation *unless* you have engaged in such conduct. Simply being unable to pay the company's debts due to business failure is not, in itself, grounds for piercing the veil. **In summary, cease trading, do not pay creditors preferentially, and seek immediate advice from a licensed insolvency practitioner. A CVL is likely the most appropriate course of action, and the IP will guide you through the process.** "	31.528416395187378	1	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.
