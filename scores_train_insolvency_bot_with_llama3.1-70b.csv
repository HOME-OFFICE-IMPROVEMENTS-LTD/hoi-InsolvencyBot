Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	I can see that you're in a difficult situation. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I'll provide you with some guidance on the steps you can take. Firstly, it's essential to understand that signing a stock transfer form does not automatically remove you as a director or terminate your responsibilities. You need to ensure that the necessary paperwork is filed with Companies House to update the company's records. In this case, it appears that the other director has not taken the necessary steps to remove you as a director, and you are still listed as a director at Companies House. This means that you may still be liable for the company's debts and actions. Given the situation, I would recommend that you take the following steps: 1. Send the keys back to the other director by recorded delivery, as you mentioned, to avoid any potential accusations of theft. 2. Write to the other director, stating that you have returned the keys and that you are not willing to take on any further responsibilities for the company. Make it clear that you expect the other director to take all necessary steps to remove you as a director and update the company's records. 3. File a TM01 form with Companies House to terminate your appointment as a director. This will help to ensure that you are no longer listed as a director and will reduce your potential liability. 4. Consider seeking the advice of a solicitor to help you navigate this situation and protect your interests. 5. If the company is insolvent, you may need to consider seeking the advice of an insolvency practitioner to help you understand your options and responsibilities. In terms of the company's insolvency, it's essential to understand that the test of commercial or cash-flow insolvency, as set out in Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch), does not exclude consideration of prospective or future debts. This means that the company's liabilities, including any contingent or prospective liabilities, will be taken into account when determining its insolvency. Additionally, the case of Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383, highlights the importance of considering both the cash-flow and balance-sheet tests when determining a company's financial condition. In terms of your potential liability as a director, the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 sets out the circumstances in which a director can be disqualified. If you are found to have been in breach of your duties as a director, you may be liable for the company's debts and could face disqualification. I hope this guidance helps. However, I would strongly recommend seeking the advice of a solicitor to help you navigate this complex situation and protect your interests. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of steps, and you should seek professional advice to ensure that you are taking the necessary actions to protect yourself and comply with the relevant laws and regulations. Also, please be aware that the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 and the relevant case law may apply to your situation, and you should seek advice from a qualified insolvency practitioner to understand your options and responsibilities. In any case, it's essential to act quickly to protect your interests and avoid any potential liability.	329.95253324508667	3	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 371 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 234 (Miscellaneous Provisions Applying to Companies Which are Insolvent or in Liquidation)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Lancefield v Lancefield [2002] 4 WLUK 467 (Jurisdiction; Partnerships; Winding-up orders)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|Bradcrown Ltd, Re [2002] B.C.C. 428 (Directors' duties and powers; Misconduct; Disqualification)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form AP01: Use this online form to appoint an individual as a company director.|Companies House Form TM01: Use this form to terminate the appointment of an individual or corporate director.|Companies House Form AM15: Use this form to give notice of the resignation of the administrator.

Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	I'm so sorry to hear about the situation you and your family are facing. It's unacceptable that your partner hasn't been paid his wages, and it's even more concerning that the subcontractor, X, is ignoring calls and texts. Firstly, I would recommend that your partner sends a formal letter to X, stating the amount owed, the dates of the work completed, and the fact that X has been ignoring his attempts to contact him. This letter should be sent via recorded delivery, so there is proof of receipt. Regarding pursuing X, Y, and the massive UK house builder, it's essential to understand the contractual relationships between these parties. As X is a subcontractor of Y, and Y is a subcontractor of the house builder, there may be a chain of liability. You may want to consider sending a letter to Y, explaining the situation and asking them to take responsibility for ensuring that X pays your partner's wages. Y may be able to exert pressure on X to pay the outstanding amount. As for the massive UK house builder, it's unlikely that they would be directly liable for your partner's wages. However, you may want to consider contacting their customer service department or their compliance team to report the issue with X. They may be able to provide guidance or support in resolving the matter. It's also worth noting that if X is unable to pay your partner's wages, it may be possible to pursue a claim against Y or the house builder for breach of contract or negligence. However, this would depend on the specific terms of the contracts between the parties. In terms of the anti-deprivation principle, as established in Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38, it's unlikely that this would apply in this situation. The anti-deprivation principle is typically used to prevent a company from avoiding its debts by transferring assets to another company. Regarding piercing the corporate veil, as established in Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22, this is a complex area of law that requires careful consideration. However, if X is a limited company, it's unlikely that the court would pierce the corporate veil to hold the directors or shareholders personally liable for the debt. In terms of next steps, I would recommend that your partner: 1. Sends a formal letter to X, as mentioned earlier. 2. Contacts Y to report the issue and ask for their assistance in resolving the matter. 3. Contacts the massive UK house builder to report the issue and ask for their guidance or support. 4. Considers seeking advice from a solicitor or a debt recovery specialist to explore options for recovering the debt. 5. Considers making a complaint to the relevant trade association or regulatory body, if applicable. I hope this advice is helpful, and I wish you and your family the best in resolving this situation.	7.826143741607666	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Companies Act 2006 section 43 (A company's capacity and related matters)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 222 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	I can sense the desperation and frustration in your situation. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and unsure about the future of your businesses. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I'm here to offer guidance and support to help you navigate this challenging situation. Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the liquidators' primary goal is to maximize the recovery of assets for the creditors of Company A. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that Company B will be forced into administration. We need to explore all available options to protect your interests and the future of Company B. Given the cross-guarantee and the intercompany loan, it's crucial to understand the implications of these agreements on Company B's financial situation. We should review the loan agreements, the RLS loan, and the mortgage on Company B to determine the best course of action. One possible approach could be to negotiate with the liquidators and the bank to reach a settlement or a payment plan that would allow Company B to avoid administration. This might involve providing additional security or making regular payments to satisfy the creditors. Another option could be to consider a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) for Company B. A CVA would allow Company B to propose a repayment plan to its creditors, which could include the bank and the liquidators. This might provide a more flexible and manageable solution for Company B, rather than facing administration. It's also essential to consider the potential consequences of administration on Company B, including the loss of control and the potential sale of the industrial unit. We should explore alternative strategies to protect your interests and the future of Company B. In terms of the intercompany loan, we should review the loan agreement to determine whether there are any provisions that could be used to mitigate the impact of the loan on Company B. For example, are there any clauses that would allow Company B to repay the loan over time, or are there any security arrangements that could be used to reduce the liability? Lastly, it's crucial to remember that you have worked hard to build your businesses over the last 17 years, and it's not necessarily the end of the road. With the right guidance and support, we can explore all available options to protect your interests and the future of Company B. I would recommend that we schedule a meeting to discuss your situation in more detail, review the relevant documents, and explore the available options. Please don't hesitate to contact me to arrange a meeting at your earliest convenience. In the meantime, I would advise you to: 1. Avoid making any significant decisions or commitments without consulting with me first. 2. Keep detailed records of all correspondence and communications with the liquidators, the bank, and any other relevant parties. 3. Be cautious of any pressure or demands from the liquidators or the bank, and ensure that you understand the implications of any proposed agreements or settlements. Remember, you are not alone in this situation, and there are options available to protect your interests and the future of Company B.	7.021989107131958	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 95 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch) (Cash flows; Notion of insolvency; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidators' powers and duties; Misfeasance; Payments in insolvency)|Maxwell Communications Corporation Plc (No 2), Re [1993] B.C.C. 369 (Debt; Schemes of arrangement; Subordination)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Eurofood IFSC ltd, Re [2006] Ch. 508 C-341/04  (Centre of main interests; EU law; Commencement; Corporate insolvency; Insolvency proceedings; Recognition of judgments; Subsidiary companies)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form WU04: Use this form to give notice of the appointment of liquidator in a winding-up by the court.|Companies House Form AM22: Use this form to give notice of a move from administration to creditors' voluntary liquidation.|Companies House Form 600CH: Use this form to tell Companies House of an appointment of liquidator in a voluntary winding up by the members or creditors.

Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"In England, the general principle is that a company's assets and liabilities are separate from those of its directors and shareholders. This is known as the ""corporate veil"" principle, established in the landmark case of Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22. However, in certain circumstances, the court may ""pierce the corporate veil"" and allow a creditor to access the assets of a company to satisfy a personal debt against a director or shareholder. This is typically done in cases where the company is being used as a sham or to evade liability. In the scenario you described, where a personal debt is owed by an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies, the creditor may attempt to access the company's assets to satisfy the debt. However, this would require the creditor to demonstrate that the company is being used as a sham or to evade liability, or that the director has breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The court may consider factors such as: * Whether the company is being used as a vehicle to avoid liability or to conceal assets * Whether the director has commingled personal and company assets * Whether the director has breached their fiduciary duties to the company * Whether the company is being used to perpetuate a fraud or other wrongdoing If the court determines that the company is being used as a sham or to evade liability, it may order the company to pay the personal debt or allow the creditor to access the company's assets. It's worth noting that the Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 provides that a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. However, this provision is typically used in the context of winding up proceedings, rather than in relation to a personal debt against a director. In summary, while the corporate veil principle generally protects a company's assets from being accessed to satisfy a personal debt against a director or shareholder, there are circumstances in which the court may pierce the corporate veil and allow a creditor to access the company's assets. However, this would require the creditor to demonstrate that the company is being used as a sham or to evade liability, or that the director has breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied.

However, in certain circumstances, the court may ""pierce the corporate veil"" and allow a creditor to access the assets of a company to satisfy a personal debt against a director or shareholder. This is typically done in cases where the company is being used as a sham or to evade liability. In the scenario you described, where a personal debt is owed by an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies, the creditor may attempt to access the company's assets to satisfy the debt. However, this would require the creditor to demonstrate that the company is being used as a sham or to evade liability, or that the director has breached their fiduciary duties to the company. The court may consider factors such as: * Whether the company is being used as a vehicle to avoid liability or to conceal assets * Whether the director has commingled personal and company assets * Whether the director has breached their fiduciary duties to the company * Whether the company is being used to perpetuate a fraud or other wrongdoing If the court determines that the company is being used as a sham or to evade liability, it may order the company to pay the personal debt or allow the creditor to access the company's assets. It's worth noting that the Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 provides that a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. However, this provision is typically used in the context of winding up proceedings, rather than in relation to a personal debt against a director. In summary, while the corporate veil principle generally protects a company's assets from being accessed to satisfy a personal debt against a director or shareholder, there are circumstances in which the court may pierce the corporate veil and allow a creditor to access the company's assets. However, this would require the creditor to demonstrate that the company is being used as a sham or to evade liability, or that the director has breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it?

Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	"I can provide you with some guidance on this matter. Firstly, it's great to hear that the company has no debt and no overdrawn directors' accounts. However, the issue with the telecoms contract is a significant one. In this scenario, the company is not insolvent in the classical sense, as it has no debts and sufficient funds to pay its VAT bills and other expenses. However, the telecoms contract is a significant liability that the company cannot afford to pay. The question is whether the company needs to appoint a liquidator solely to deal with this contract. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, a company can be wound up by the court if it is unable to pay its debts (section 123). However, in this case, the company is not unable to pay its debts in the classical sense. The issue is that it has a contractual liability that it cannot afford to pay. In Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38, the Supreme Court held that the anti-deprivation principle does not apply to contractual provisions that are entered into in good faith and for a legitimate commercial purpose. However, this case is not directly applicable to your situation. In Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch), the court held that the test of commercial or cash-flow insolvency does not exclude consideration of prospective or future debts. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383, the Court of Appeal held that the cash-flow and balance-sheet tests need to be used at the same time to determine the financial condition of a debtor. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA), the court held that hopes and expectations of future funding without any rights to those assets are irrelevant. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch), the court held that the duty to protect creditors' interests under the Companies Act 2006 section 172 applies when the company is insolvent or of doubtful solvency. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7, the court held that the general rule in equity that a person cannot share in the distribution of a fund in relation to which he is also a debtor, without first contributing to the whole by paying his debt, applies also in the case of a double corporate insolvency where no set-off is available between the debts. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28, the Supreme Court held that the ability of a company to meet its liabilities, both prospective and contingent, is to be determined on the balance of probabilities with the burden of proof on the party asserting ""balance-sheet insolvency"". However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In this scenario, the company is not insolvent in the classical sense, but it has a contractual liability that it cannot afford to pay. The question is whether the company needs to appoint a liquidator solely to deal with this contract. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, a company can be wound up by the court if it is unable to pay its debts (section 123). However, in this case, the company is not unable to pay its debts in the classical sense. The issue is that it has a contractual liability that it cannot afford to pay. In this scenario, the company may need to consider appointing a liquidator to deal with the telecoms contract. However, this would depend on the specific circumstances of the case. It's recommended that you seek professional advice from a qualified insolvency practitioner or a solicitor who specializes in insolvency law. They can provide you with more specific guidance on this matter and help you navigate the process. In terms of the process, you would need to file a petition with the court to wind up the company. You would also need to provide evidence to support the petition, including financial statements and other relevant documents. Once the petition is filed, the court will consider the application and make a decision. If the court grants the petition, the company will be wound up, and a liquidator will be appointed to deal with the company's assets and liabilities. In terms of the telecoms contract, the liquidator would need to negotiate with the telecoms provider to try to reach a settlement. If a settlement cannot be reached, the liquidator may need to take further action to try to recover the debt. It's worth noting that the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 provide a framework for the winding-up process. You can find more information on the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 on the GOV.UK website. You can also find more information on the Companies House website, including guidance on how to file a petition to wind up a company. In terms of the forms you would need to complete, you would need to file a petition with the court using Form 4.2 (Petition for winding-up by the company or its directors). You would also need to provide evidence to support the petition, including financial statements and other relevant documents. You can find more information on the forms you would need to complete on the GOV.UK website. I hope this helps.

Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?

Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	"I can provide you with some guidance on this matter. Firstly, it's great to hear that the company has no debt and no overdrawn directors' accounts. However, the issue with the telecoms contract is a significant one. In this scenario, the company is not insolvent in the classical sense, as it has no debts and sufficient funds to pay its VAT bills and other expenses. However, the telecoms contract is a significant liability that the company cannot afford to pay. The question is whether the company needs to appoint a liquidator solely to deal with this contract. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, a company can be wound up by the court if it is unable to pay its debts (section 123). However, in this case, the company is not unable to pay its debts in the classical sense. The issue is that it has a contractual liability that it cannot afford to pay. In Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38, the Supreme Court held that the anti-deprivation principle does not apply to contractual provisions that are entered into in good faith and for a legitimate commercial purpose. However, this case is not directly applicable to your situation. In Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch), the court held that the test of commercial or cash-flow insolvency does not exclude consideration of prospective or future debts. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383, the Court of Appeal held that the cash-flow and balance-sheet tests need to be used at the same time to determine the financial condition of a debtor. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA), the court held that hopes and expectations of future funding without any rights to those assets are irrelevant. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch), the court held that the duty to protect creditors' interests under the Companies Act 2006 section 172 applies when the company is insolvent or of doubtful solvency. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7, the court held that the general rule in equity that a person cannot share in the distribution of a fund in relation to which he is also a debtor, without first contributing to the whole by paying his debt, applies also in the case of a double corporate insolvency where no set-off is available between the debts. However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28, the Supreme Court held that the ability of a company to meet its liabilities, both prospective and contingent, is to be determined on the balance of probabilities with the burden of proof on the party asserting ""balance-sheet insolvency"". However, this case is also not directly applicable to your situation. In this scenario, the company is not insolvent in the classical sense, but it has a contractual liability that it cannot afford to pay. The question is whether the company needs to appoint a liquidator solely to deal with this contract. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, a company can be wound up by the court if it is unable to pay its debts (section 123). However, in this case, the company is not unable to pay its debts in the classical sense. The issue is that it has a contractual liability that it cannot afford to pay. In this scenario, the company may need to consider appointing a liquidator to deal with the telecoms contract. However, this would depend on the specific circumstances of the case. It's recommended that you seek professional advice from a qualified insolvency practitioner or a solicitor who specializes in insolvency law. They can provide you with more specific guidance on this matter and help you navigate the process. In terms of the process, you would need to file a petition with the court to wind up the company. You would also need to provide evidence to support the petition, including financial statements and other relevant documents. Once the petition is filed, the court will consider the application and make a decision. If the court grants the petition, the company will be wound up, and a liquidator will be appointed to deal with the company's assets and liabilities. In terms of the telecoms contract, the liquidator would need to negotiate with the telecoms provider to try to reach a settlement. If a settlement cannot be reached, the liquidator may need to take further action to try to recover the debt. It's worth noting that the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 provide a framework for the winding-up process. You can find more information on the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 on the GOV.UK website. You can also find more information on the Companies House website, including guidance on how to file a petition to wind up a company. In terms of the forms you would need to complete, you would need to file a petition with the court using Form 4.2 (Petition for winding-up by the company or its directors). You would also need to provide evidence to support the petition, including financial statements and other relevant documents. You can find more information on the forms you would need to complete on the GOV.UK website. I hope this helps.

Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult situation. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I'll provide you with some guidance and advice. Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the situation you're in is not uncommon, and there are ways to address the issues you're facing. Regarding the illegal dividends, it's crucial to understand that as a director, you have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company. The case of McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) highlights the importance of directors' duties and powers, particularly in relation to limited liability partnerships, liquidation, and misfeasance. In your case, the fact that you've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of £35,000 is a serious matter. However, it's essential to note that you've already taken steps to address the issue by switching to a new accounting practice and seeking advice from a local liquidator. Regarding the potential for personal bankruptcy, it's true that this could have severe consequences on your future prospects. However, it's not the only option available to you. You may want to consider alternative solutions, such as an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) or a Debt Management Plan (DMP). In terms of independent advice, I would recommend seeking the help of a qualified insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in corporate insolvency. They can provide you with guidance on the best course of action and help you navigate the complex process of dealing with the company's debts and your personal financial situation. Additionally, you may want to consider the following: 1. Review your company's financial records and accounts to ensure that they are accurate and up-to-date. 2. Seek advice on the potential for a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) or a Pre-Pack Administration, which could help the company avoid liquidation. 3. Consider the potential for a Directors' Disqualification Order, which could be made against you if the court determines that you have been unfit to act as a director. 4. Review your personal financial situation and consider seeking advice on debt management and potential bankruptcy alternatives. In terms of relevant statutes and case law, you may want to familiarize yourself with the following: * Companies Act 2006 section 414 (Accounts and reports) * Companies Act 2006 section 472 (Accounts and reports) * Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts) * Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts) * Companies Act 2006 section 393 (Accounts and reports) * Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 * Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 Relevant Companies House forms include: * Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs. * Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early. * Companies House Form 600CH: Use this form to tell Companies House of an appointment of liquidator in a voluntary winding up by the members or creditors. I hope this information is helpful, and I strongly advise you to seek professional advice from a qualified insolvency practitioner or solicitor specializing in corporate insolvency.	170.4518277645111	2	Companies Act 2006 section 414 (Accounts and reports)|Companies Act 2006 section 472 (Accounts and reports)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Companies Act 2006 section 393 (Accounts and reports)	McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)|Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477 (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors; Disqualification; Misconduct)|Pathania v Tashie-Lewis [2021] EWHC 526 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Transactions at an undervalue)|Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors disqualification; Directors' powers and duties;)|Re Glam and Tan Ltd [2022] EWHC 855 (Ch) (De facto directors; Directors' powers and duties; Distributions; Dividends; Liquidators' powers and duties)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25 (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Spectrum Plus Ltd, Re [2005] UKHL 41 (Distribution of Assets; Book debts; Debentures; Fixed charges; Floating charges; Liquidation; Preferential creditors; Proof of debt; Security)|Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' powers and duties; Contingent liabilities; Directors' liabilities; Knowledge; Liquidation; Wrongful trading)|Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733 (Damages; Directors; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidation; Wrongful trading; iNVESTIGATING AND SUPPRESSING MISCONDUCT)|Morris v Bank of India [2004] EWHC 528 (Ch) (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Vicarious liability; Parent company; Tortious liability)	Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.|Companies House Form 600CH: Use this form to tell Companies House of an appointment of liquidator in a voluntary winding up by the members or creditors.

Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006) applies in situations where there is a transfer of an undertaking, business, or part of an undertaking or business. This can include a change of ownership, a merger, or a transfer of a contract. In the scenario you described, where a new butcher is taking over the premises of a butcher that has gone into administration, TUPE may apply. However, it depends on the specific circumstances. For TUPE to apply, there must be a transfer of an economic entity that retains its identity. This means that the new business must be taking over the same or similar activities, and the transfer must involve the transfer of assets, employees, or customers. In this case, if the new butcher is simply taking over the premises and starting a new business, TUPE may not apply. However, if the new butcher is taking over the assets, equipment, and employees of the old business, or if the new business is continuing to operate in a similar way to the old business, then TUPE may apply. The key factors to consider are: 1. Is the new business taking over the same or similar activities as the old business? 2. Is the new business taking over the assets, equipment, and employees of the old business? 3. Is the new business continuing to operate in a similar way to the old business? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then TUPE may apply, and the new business may be required to take on the employees of the old business, along with their existing contracts and terms and conditions. It's worth noting that the administrators of the old business may have a duty to inform the employees of the potential transfer and to consult with them about the implications of TUPE. The new business may also have a duty to inform the employees of the transfer and to provide them with information about their new employer. In any case, it's always best to seek advice from a qualified employment lawyer or HR professional to determine whether TUPE applies in a specific situation.	5.4269609451293945	1	Companies Act 2006 section 1204 (Business names)|Companies Act 2006 section 853C (Annual confirmation of accuracy of information on register)|Companies Act 2006 section 247 (A company's directors)	SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7 (Creditors; Deeds; Distribution of assets; Equitable charges; Indemnities; Set-off; Subordination)|Metro Nominees (Wandsworth) (No 1) Ltd v Rayment [2008] B.C.C. 40 (Administration; Breach of covenant; Business tenancies; Forfeiture; Permission)|Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2), Re [1990] B.C.C. 605 (Administration; Duty of care; Sale of business; Unfairly prejudicial conduct)	Companies House Form MR02: Use this form to register particulars of a charge where property has been acquired and the charge was created on or after 6 April 2013.|Companies House Form PSC04: Use this form to give notice of change of details for person with significant control.|Companies House Form PSC07: Use this form to give notice of ceasing to be an individual person with significant control, relevant legal entity or other registrable person.		0.0		0	
Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	I can sense the emotional weight of your situation, and I'm here to offer guidance and support. It's commendable that you've been open with HSBC about your company's financial struggles, and their willingness to work with you is a positive step. Given your circumstances, it's essential to understand the options available for closing your company. Since you've mentioned that you cannot afford to liquidate the company and HSBC has indicated they won't pursue liquidation for the £12,000 Bounce Back Loan, you may be considering striking off the company. To strike off a company, you'll need to follow the process outlined in the Companies Act 2006. You can apply to Companies House to strike off the company using Form DS01. However, before doing so, you should ensure that: 1. The company has no outstanding debts, except for the Bounce Back Loan, which is currently on a payment holiday. 2. You've notified all relevant parties, including HMRC, about the company's intention to strike off. 3. You've settled any outstanding tax liabilities or made arrangements to pay them. It's crucial to note that striking off a company will not necessarily release you from your personal liability as a director. You may still be liable for any debts or obligations incurred by the company, including the Bounce Back Loan. Considering your situation, it might be beneficial to explore alternative options, such as: 1. Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL): Although you mentioned that you cannot afford to liquidate the company, an MVL might be a more suitable option. This process allows the company to be wound up in a controlled manner, and the costs can be paid from the company's assets. 2. Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL): If you're unable to pay the Bounce Back Loan, you may need to consider a CVL. This process involves the company being wound up, and the assets are distributed among the creditors. It's recommended that you consult with a licensed insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in insolvency law to discuss your options in more detail. They can help you navigate the process and ensure that you're taking the most appropriate steps for your situation. Remember, it's essential to prioritize your personal financial well-being and seek professional advice to minimize any potential risks or liabilities. In terms of the timeline for striking off the company, it's difficult to provide an exact timeframe without knowing the specifics of your situation. However, if you decide to strike off the company, you can expect the process to take several months. Companies House will typically take 2-3 months to process the application, and the company will be struck off the register once the application is approved. However, this timeframe can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the workload of Companies House. I hope this information helps you understand your options and the process involved in closing your company. Remember to seek professional advice to ensure that you're making the best decisions for your situation.	337.0002951622009	3	Insolvency Act 1986 section A18 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251G (Debt relief orders)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)|Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477 (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors; Disqualification; Misconduct)|Pathania v Tashie-Lewis [2021] EWHC 526 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Transactions at an undervalue)|Re Pure Zanzibar Ltd [2022] EWHC 971 (Ch) (Creditors' voluntary winding-up; Directors disqualification; Disqualification periods; Mitigation; Wrongful trading)|Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors disqualification; Directors' powers and duties;)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25 (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' powers and duties; Contingent liabilities; Directors' liabilities; Knowledge; Liquidation; Wrongful trading)|Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733 (Damages; Directors; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidation; Wrongful trading; iNVESTIGATING AND SUPPRESSING MISCONDUCT)|Morris v Bank of India [2004] EWHC 528 (Ch) (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Vicarious liability; Parent company; Tortious liability)	Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form RT01: Use this form to apply to Companies House to get your company restored.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.

Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	I can sense the emotional weight of your situation, and I'm here to offer guidance and support. It's commendable that you've been open with HSBC about your company's financial struggles, and their willingness to work with you is a positive step. Given your circumstances, it's essential to understand the options available for closing your company. Since you've mentioned that you cannot afford to liquidate the company and HSBC has indicated they won't pursue liquidation for the £12,000 Bounce Back Loan, you may be considering striking off the company. To strike off a company, you'll need to follow the process outlined in the Companies Act 2006. You can apply to Companies House to strike off the company using Form DS01. However, before doing so, you should ensure that: 1. The company has no outstanding debts, except for the Bounce Back Loan, which is currently on a payment holiday. 2. You've notified all relevant parties, including HMRC, about the company's intention to strike off. 3. You've settled any outstanding tax liabilities or made arrangements to pay them. It's crucial to note that striking off a company will not necessarily release you from your personal liability as a director. You may still be liable for any debts or obligations incurred by the company, including the Bounce Back Loan. Considering your situation, it might be beneficial to explore alternative options, such as: 1. Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL): Although you mentioned that you cannot afford to liquidate the company, an MVL might be a more suitable option. This process allows the company to be wound up in a controlled manner, and the costs can be paid from the company's assets. 2. Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL): If you're unable to pay the Bounce Back Loan, you may need to consider a CVL. This process involves the company being wound up, and the assets are distributed among the creditors. It's recommended that you consult with a licensed insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in insolvency law to discuss your options in more detail. They can help you navigate the process and ensure that you're taking the most appropriate steps for your situation. Remember, it's essential to prioritize your personal financial well-being and seek professional advice to minimize any potential risks or liabilities. In terms of the timeline for striking off the company, it's difficult to provide an exact timeframe without knowing the specifics of your situation. However, if you decide to strike off the company, you can expect the process to take several months. Companies House will typically take 2-3 months to process the application, and the company will be struck off the register once the application is approved. However, this timeframe can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the workload of Companies House. I hope this information helps you understand your options and the process involved in closing your company. Remember to seek professional advice to ensure that you're making the best decisions for your situation.	486.1883089542389	3	Insolvency Act 1986 section A18 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251G (Debt relief orders)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)|Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477 (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors; Disqualification; Misconduct)|Pathania v Tashie-Lewis [2021] EWHC 526 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Transactions at an undervalue)|Re Pure Zanzibar Ltd [2022] EWHC 971 (Ch) (Creditors' voluntary winding-up; Directors disqualification; Disqualification periods; Mitigation; Wrongful trading)|Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors disqualification; Directors' powers and duties;)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25 (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' powers and duties; Contingent liabilities; Directors' liabilities; Knowledge; Liquidation; Wrongful trading)|Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733 (Damages; Directors; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidation; Wrongful trading; iNVESTIGATING AND SUPPRESSING MISCONDUCT)|Morris v Bank of India [2004] EWHC 528 (Ch) (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Vicarious liability; Parent company; Tortious liability)	Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form RT01: Use this form to apply to Companies House to get your company restored.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.

Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	Based on the information provided, it appears that you are in the process of winding up your limited business. You have stopped trading, vacated the premises, and have no official debts except for directors' loans and outstanding utility bills. As a director, you have a duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. In this case, you have £600 left in the business account, and you need to prioritize the payment of outstanding debts. The order of priority for payment of debts in a winding-up scenario is typically as follows: 1. Preferential creditors: These include employees, HMRC, and other creditors who have a statutory priority over other creditors. 2. Secured creditors: These include creditors who have a security interest in the company's assets, such as a mortgage or a charge. 3. Unsecured creditors: These include creditors who do not have a security interest in the company's assets, such as utility providers and suppliers. In your case, the outstanding utility bills (energy, water, and broadband) are unsecured creditors. As a director, you should prioritize the payment of these debts to the extent possible. You should also consider the directors' loans, which are essentially loans made by you and your wife to the company. These loans are not considered debts in the classical sense, but rather a form of equity. However, as a director, you may be required to repay these loans in the event of a winding-up. In terms of the anti-deprivation principle, which is a principle that prevents a company from depriving its creditors of assets or value, you should ensure that you are not taking any actions that could be seen as depriving the creditors of their rightful claims. Based on the Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 case, the court will consider whether the actions taken by the company were in good faith and whether they were intended to evade the insolvency laws. In your case, it appears that you have acted in good faith and have taken steps to wind up the company in an orderly manner. However, you should ensure that you are prioritizing the payment of outstanding debts and taking steps to minimize any potential losses to creditors. In terms of what will happen when the creditors chase you for any remainder, it is likely that they will send you a demand letter or take other enforcement action to recover the outstanding debts. As a director, you may be personally liable for any debts that are not paid, although this will depend on the specific circumstances of the case. It is recommended that you seek the advice of a qualified insolvency practitioner or solicitor to ensure that you are taking the correct steps to wind up the company and minimize any potential liabilities. In terms of the relevant statute, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 provides that a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due. In your case, it appears that the company is unable to pay its debts, and therefore, it is likely that the company will be wound up. The Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 provides that a winding-up petition may be presented by a creditor or creditors, and the court may make a winding-up order if it is satisfied that the company is unable to pay its debts. The Companies Act 2006 section 251 provides that a shadow director is a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to act. In your case, it appears that you and your wife are the only directors, and therefore, you are not considered shadow directors. The Companies Act 2006 section 154 provides that a private company must have at least one director, and a public company must have at least two directors. In your case, you and your wife are the only directors, and therefore, you are in compliance with this section. The relevant case law, including Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22, Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34, and Gilford Motor Co. Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch. 935, provides guidance on the concept of piercing the corporate veil and the duties of directors in a winding-up scenario. In terms of the relevant Companies House forms, the Form DS01 is used to apply to strike off a company from the Companies House register, and the Form LIQ06 is used to give notice of a liquidator's resignation in members' voluntary liquidation or creditors' voluntary liquidation. The Form LIQ04 is used to give notice of order deferring the date of dissolution in members' voluntary liquidation or creditors' voluntary liquidation. It is recommended that you seek the advice of a qualified insolvency practitioner or solicitor to ensure that you are taking the correct steps to wind up the company and minimize any potential liabilities.	7.260005712509155	1	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.
