Q1	I set up a limited liability company in 2015. My business suffered greatly during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it still hasn’t recovered yet. I fell into arrears, and one of my suppliers submitted a winding-up petition against my business. A friend of mine is willing to invest money in my company. Do I have good chances of avoiding a liquidation order if my friend commits to pumping money into my business?	To assess your chances of avoiding a liquidation order, it's important to consider several factors, including the current financial state of your company, the impact of COVID-19 on your business, and the evidence you can provide to the court. Here's a structured approach based on relevant case law and statutes: 1. **Impact of COVID-19**: In the cases of Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch) and Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131, the courts focused on whether the company's financial difficulties were genuinely attributable to COVID-19. If you can demonstrate that the pandemic significantly impacted your business and that your business was otherwise viable, this could be a substantial factor in your favor. 2. **Evidence of Investment**: The possibility of receiving a financial boost from a friend could be beneficial. However, as seen in Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986), the court may not be persuaded merely by speculative hopes and expectations of funding without definitive evidence and committed funding. You should have a clear, documented commitment from your friend to ensure this investment is taken seriously. 3. **Commercial and Balance Sheet Insolvency**: As highlighted in Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] and Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014], courts consider both cash-flow and balance-sheet tests of insolvency. It's crucial to prepare evidence demonstrating your company's ability to meet its debts (using Cheyne's insights about prospective liabilities) and that the balance sheet will improve with the incoming investment. 4. **Court's Authority and Moratorium**: Under section 123 and section A4 of the Insolvency Act 1986, you might consider applying for a moratorium, which could pause the winding-up petition, especially if it facilitates a better outcome for creditors with the new investment plan. You should ensure that necessary documents and a solid business plan are in place to apply for this. 5. **Fiduciary Duty**: You must act in the best interest of creditors if insolvency is apparent (BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016]). Ensuring that the injection of funds is used wisely to stabilize and grow the business is critical. 6. **Procedural Requirements**: Be aware of the procedural requirements, such as using forms like LIQ03 and MT03 for reporting progress in any voluntary or court-ordered winding-up processes. In conclusion, your chances of avoiding a liquidation order could be improved by providing strong evidence of COVID-19’s impact on your business, a firm commitment from your friend regarding investment, and a clear financial plan demonstrating the company's potential to regain solvency. It may also be beneficial to apply for a moratorium to gain some breathing room from the winding-up process. I recommend seeking tailored legal advice to strengthen your case with specific evidence and strategic actions in your particular circumstances.	6.27280330657959	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 208 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A4 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	"Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch) (Coronavirus; Winding-up petition)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q2	My business has been running at a deficit for a few years. In 2021, I got a loan from NatWest to stay afloat. I have given my share in the family home (50%) as a collateral for this loan. I am now unable to repay it. What should I do? Can the bank repossess my house?	If your business is running at a deficit and you're unable to repay the loan secured against your share in the family home, several legal options and considerations need to be addressed. 1. **Review Loan Agreement**: First, carefully review your loan agreement with NatWest to understand the terms, including any clauses related to default and repossession of the collateral. 2. **Insolvency Considerations**: If your company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, this may indicate insolvency under the Insolvency Act 1986, section 123. You might consider whether the company is bordering on insolvent liquidation or administration, which was deliberated in BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25 regarding directors’ duties. 3. **Rescue Procedures**: Evaluate whether entering administration could be a viable option. Rowntree Ventures Ltd v Oak Property Partners Ltd [2016] highlighted that administration could be beneficial if it achieves the purpose of administration and if the company is unable to pay its debts. 4. **Avoiding Personal Liability**: As a director, ensure that you are not involved in wrongful trading. Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 emphasizes the importance of not continuing to trade when there is no reasonable prospect of avoiding liquidation which could result in personal liabilities. 5. **Negotiation with the Bank**: It’s often advisable to negotiate with the bank to explore restructuring the loan or an alternative repayment plan. This might include extending the repayment term or reducing monthly payments. 6. **Repossession Risk**: If you're unable to come to an agreement, and your share in the family home is explicitly listed as collateral for the loan, NatWest could potentially move to repossess your share of the property. It's vital to act quickly to potentially mitigate this, possibly through legal advice or by negotiating sale terms. 7. **Legal Advice**: Seek legal advice promptly to discuss your specific circumstances and explore potential defenses or strategies. An insolvency practitioner may provide guidance specific to your situation and help avoid the repossession of your property. 8. **Personal Bankruptcy**: If personal liabilities are unmanageable, consider the implications of personal bankruptcy under the Insolvency Act 1986. Sections 329 and 332 discuss priority and treatment of debts in bankruptcy, which could affect your strategy regarding the loan secured by your home. Remember, each situation is unique, so tailored legal advice would be necessary to provide a more detailed and actionable plan based on the specifics of your case and current insolvency laws.	6.893453121185303	1	Companies Act 2006 section 899A (Arrangements and reconstructions: general])|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 332 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 329 (Bankruptcy)	"McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)|Rowntree Ventures Ltd v Oak Property Partners Ltd [2016] EWHC 1523 (Ch) (Rescue Procedures; Notion of insolvency; Cash-flows; Balance-sheets; Inability to pay debts)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q3	My business (a small restaurant in Egham) is saddled with debt towards several suppliers. I do have a loyal customer base, but I feel that I need to reduce my debt burden. My brother offered to buy my business for a fair price, and he also told me he would like to retain me and some of my employees. However, he says that I need to deal with my debt before selling the business to him. I don’t have savings. What can I do?	Given your situation, there are several options and legal considerations to help manage your debt and potentially sell your business. Here’s what you could consider: 1. **Assess Your Financial Condition:** - First, evaluate your business's financial condition to determine if it is cash-flow insolvent (unable to pay debts as they fall due) or balance-sheet insolvent (liabilities exceed assets). As per the rulings in **Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007]** and **Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014]**, both cash-flow and balance-sheet tests should be considered to get a full picture. 2. **Negotiate with Creditors:** - Open discussions with your suppliers to see if they would agree to restructuring your debt or accepting a repayment plan. A creditor wanting a reasonable chance at recovering debt might show flexibility. 3. **Consider a Voluntary Arrangement:** - A Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) might be a suitable option if you wish to reach an agreement with your creditors on paying back a portion of your debts over time while continuing trading. This requires approval from creditors holding 75% of the debt. 4. **Explore Administration:** - If restructuring isn’t feasible, placing the company into administration can protect it from creditors while you work on a business rescue plan. This could stabilise your business to allow for a more organised exit plan. 5. **Insolvency Proceedings:** - If selling or restructuring isn’t feasible, you might consider formal insolvency proceedings. Seek legal advice first to avoid unintentionally breaching directors' duties, as seen in **BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016]**. 6. **Legal Considerations on Transfer or Disposal:** - Be mindful of the 'anti-deprivation principle' from **Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38**, which prevents parties from including contractual provisions that remove value from an insolvent estate to the detriment of creditors. - Additionally, assure that any sale is not considered a transaction at an undervalue under the Insolvency Act 1986, Section 238, which could be set aside. 7. **Document and Report:** - Regularly update and document your company’s financial position and, if entering formal proceedings, make sure to file necessary forms, such as the Companies House Form LIQ02 for notice of a statement of affairs. In all cases, I strongly advise consulting with an insolvency practitioner or a lawyer specialising in insolvency to explore the most viable and compliant solutions for your specific situation. This will help to pursue a course of action properly aligned with your brother wanting to acquire your business.	6.215322017669678	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 149 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q4	I own a pub in Windsor. I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, by additional taxes on alcohol as well as by a reduction in my customer base. I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). I reached an agreement with my bank and with most of my suppliers to delay the repayment of my debt. The HMRC won’t listen and they are threatening legal actions against me. What can I do? HMRC counts for roughly 50% of my unsecured debt (the debt towards the bank is secured by a collateral on my pub).	As the owner of a pub facing financial difficulties, you are dealing with a complex situation that involves multiple creditors, including HMRC, with whom you've been unable to reach a compromise. Here are some potential steps you could consider: 1. **Negotiate with HMRC**: While it seems that previous negotiations have not been successful, it might be worth making another attempt with a detailed proposal. This could include showing your willingness to pay through a Time to Pay Agreement, which is a formal arrangement with HMRC to pay debts over a more extended period. It's crucial to ensure this proposal is realistic and backed by evidence of your current financial position. 2. **Consider a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: A CVA is a structured agreement with your creditors to pay off a proportion of your debts over time. It requires the approval of 75% of creditors (by value of debt), excluding secured creditors and preferential creditors. HMRC's consent would be crucial, given they hold 50% of your unsecured debt. A CVA allows you to continue trading while repaying your debts and prevents creditors from taking legal action against you. 3. **Explore a Moratorium**: A moratorium provides temporary protection from creditor action while you attempt to reach an agreement with your creditors. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, Section A28, a moratorium allows for certain payments exceeding a specified amount only with a monitor's consent or a court order. This might offer you the breathing space needed to stabilize your financial situation. 4. **Consider Solvent Restructuring Options**: Check if your business could benefit from a more fundamental restructuring, possibly involving refinancing your secured debt or finding new investment. Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 underscores the importance of prioritizing legitimate restructuring efforts that are conducted in good faith and do not aim to undermine insolvency principles. 5. **Assess Your Personal Situation**: As you have secured debt with your pub as collateral, ensure you understand the implications of any restructuring or insolvency proceedings on your personal assets. 6. **Professional Legal and Financial Advice**: Given the complexity of insolvency law and the potential consequences of various actions, it’s crucial to seek professional legal and financial advice. An insolvency practitioner could assist in negotiating with HMRC and other creditors, and guide you through any insolvency procedures if necessary. Remember, the strategy should be tailored to your specific situation, balancing the need to repay creditors with the aim of preferably keeping your business operational.	5.767838478088379	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A28 (Moratorium)|Companies Act 2006 section 899A (Arrangements and reconstructions: general])|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251G (Debt relief orders)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q5	I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, as well as by a reduction in my customer base (I run a pub in Ascot). I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). My landlord is demanding an extortionate amount of money for my rent. While I agreed to a new, 5-year leasing agreement, I realised that I am operating at a loss unless my rent is reduced and the HMRC agrees to a repayment plan. What can I do?	"Given your challenging financial situation, there are a few options you can consider to help manage your debts and hopefully stabilize your business: 1. **Engage with Creditors and the HMRC:** - **HMRC:** You may consider contacting the HMRC to discuss a ""Time to Pay Arrangement."" This could give you more time to pay your tax debts in installments. It's crucial to approach them proactively and explain your situation. - **Suppliers and Landlord:** Open communication with your suppliers and landlord is essential. You could negotiate payment terms with suppliers or seek a rent reduction or deferment with your landlord. 2. **Evaluate Restructuring Options:** - **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** Consider proposing a CVA, which is a formal process to reach an agreement with creditors to pay back a proportion of your debts over time. This might allow you to continue trading and retain control of your business. - **Moratorium:** A temporary moratorium could also give you breathing space to consider restructuring options, as it would prevent creditors from taking action against you. You might need to file Companies House Form MT03 if the moratorium arrangements change. 3. **Review of Business Operations:** Consider seeking advice on business efficiency and areas where you can reduce costs or increase revenue. This might mean adjusting your business model or negotiating better terms with suppliers. 4. **Legal Framework and Potential Winding Up:** - If your financial difficulties persist and formal insolvency procedures become necessary—such as liquidation—you may need to provide a progress report using Companies House Form LIQ03 if you enter voluntary liquidation. - The Insolvency Act 1986 (particularly sections 222 and 224) outlines the procedures for winding up companies, which may become relevant if you cannot reach a satisfactory arrangement with creditors. 5. **Professional Advice:** - You should consider consulting with an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in commercial insolvency matters to discuss the specifics of your case and provide tailored advice. 6. **Directors' Duties and Fiduciary Considerations:** - Given precedents such as BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016], it’s essential to bear in mind your duties as a director. While you act in the interests of shareholders, once a company faces financial distress, you must consider creditors’ interests. These steps can potentially provide a strategic path forward, but early and proactive action is key. Seek professional assistance to better understand and navigate the complexities of your situation."	5.862591505050659	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 222 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)|Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 224 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Oceanfill Ltd v Nuffield Health Wellbeing Ltd [2022] EWHC 2178 (Ch) (Business restructuring; Debt restructuring; Guarantors; Schemes of arrangement; Summary judgments)	Companies House Form LIQ03: Use this form to give notice of progress report in voluntary winding up.|Companies House Form RT01: Use this form to apply to Companies House to get your company restored.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.
Q6	I am a real estate developer. Due to the current housing crisis, my mortgages have ballooned, and I am struggling to make money out of the sale of the properties I recently completed. While my housing portfolio is significant, most properties are not yet ready for the market. I am not paying all my suppliers, and the banks are chasing me multiple times per day. If they foreclose, I lose everything. If I complete all my projects, I can repay the banks and the suppliers. However, one of them just filed a petition for winding up my business. I refuse to believe I am insolvent. Is it likely that the petition will be dismissed?	Given your situation, the petition for winding up your business will likely pivot on whether the court sees your company as insolvent based on its current ability to pay debts. Insolvency can be viewed through two main tests: the cash-flow test and the balance-sheet test, as seen in cases like *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)* and *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383*. 1. **Cash-Flow Test**: This assesses whether your company can pay its debts as they fall due. You mentioned you're not paying all suppliers, and the banks are actively pursuing you, which may support a finding of cash-flow insolvency. 2. **Balance-Sheet Test**: This looks at whether your assets are less than your liabilities, considering prospective and contingent liabilities (as affirmed in *BNY Corporate Trustee Service Ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28*). Your housing portfolio, albeit not market-ready, might be considered while assessing the balance-sheet. To counter the winding-up petition, you would need to demonstrate that your financial situation does not equate to insolvency under these tests. For instance, you might provide evidence of the value of your projects (current and prospective) and a plan to generate revenue, which could portray your company as solvent and dispute the claim of inability to pay debts. The court's decision would also consider if dismissing the petition potentially leads to a better outcome for creditors, akin to the considerations under a moratorium as per *Insolvency Act 1986 section A4*. If you believe your business is viable, you may pursue an injunction to restrain the winding-up petition. Ensure that your legal representation has correct and verified authority to act on behalf of your company, unlike the mistakenly unauthorized in *Rushbrooke UK Ltd v 4 Design Concepts Ltd [2022] EWHC 1110 (Ch)*. It's prudent to seek immediate legal advice. Engaging an insolvency practitioner might provide additional options for re-structuring and negotiating with creditors, potentially averting the winding-up process. Lastly, be prepared for documentation and financial statements to demonstrate your business's viability clearly. Consider filing relevant notices and forms with Companies House, like withdrawing any striking-off applications using Form DS02 or responding to winding-up progress with Form WU07.	5.661282539367676	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A4 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 7.4 (WINDING UP BY THE COURT)	Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch) (Coronavirus; Winding-up petition)|Rushbrooke UK Ltd v 4 Design Concepts Ltd [2022] EWHC 1110 (Ch) (Cross-Border Insolvency; Authority; Directors; Injunctions; Statutory demands; Striking out; Winding-up petitions)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|One Blackfriars Ltd (in liq.), Re [2021] EWHC 684 (Ch) (Administration; Administrators' powers and duties; Conflict of interest; Valuation)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form WU07: Use this form to give notice of a progress report in a winding-up by the court.|Companies House Form DS02: Use this form to withdraw your company's striking off application.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.
Q7	My brother and I have been working together on our hand-made furniture shop for 20+ years. Last year, we had to liquidate the business because we could no longer pay the bills. An official receiver was appointed. Yesterday, he came back to us and asked to repay all the dividends we received in the 5 years before insolvency. This is a ridiculous amount of money (£150,000 each). My brother and I never received a salary. The official receiver says that we could not get any dividends because the business was operating at a loss. We were only paid in dividends to avoid income tax, and because my accountant told me that was fine. Surely, we don’t have to repay that money?	Based on the situation you described, the official receiver is likely seeking repayment of dividends because they believe these payments contravened insolvency principles, specifically those relating to the distribution of company assets when a company is insolvent. Here are some key legal points to consider: 1. **Wrongful Trading and Dividends**: Under the Insolvency Act 1986, directors have a duty to consider creditors' interests when the company is approaching insolvency. If dividends were paid while the company was insolvent, this could be challenged as an unlawful dividend. Directors are expected to refrain from actions that could diminish the assets available to creditors. 2. **Insolvency Act 1986, Section 123**: This section outlines circumstances under which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts. If your company was deemed insolvent at the time dividends were paid, these payments could be seen as improper. 3. **Misfeasance or Breach of Duty**: As directors, you may be held liable for breach of fiduciary duties if you continued to pay dividends when it was clear (or should have been clear) that the company was in financial trouble. This is supported by **BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016]**, which highlights directors' obligations towards creditors in the shadow of insolvency. 4. **Return of Dividends**: If the dividends were indeed paid unlawfully, the official receiver might seek recovery on behalf of the creditors, as defined under sections such as 132 of the Insolvency Act 1986, which covers investigations into company affairs during winding-up. 5. **Advice from Accountants**: Relying on professional advice does not absolve directors of their duties under the Companies Act 2006 and insolvency legislation. Directors must ensure they understand their legal obligations independently of advisers, particularly regarding financial solvency. 6. **Potential Defenses**: You may have defenses, such as showing good faith reliance on professional accountants or justifying that at the time of distributing dividends, you reasonably believed the company was solvent and dividends were lawfully declared based on available profits in line with company law. Given the complexity and potential for significant financial repercussions, I strongly recommend consulting with an insolvency lawyer who can assess your case in detail and provide tailored advice.

Q8	My business went into liquidation last year. I was the owner and director. A liquidator was appointed. He is threatening to sue me for breaching my duties as a director unless I return the money I received as monthly repayments for a loan I gave to my company. He’s also threatening to start a disqualification procedure against me for the same reason. I believe I did nothing wrong – this was a fair loan with interests below the market rate. However, I cannot risk being disqualified, because I am also working as a director in my sister’s company. What can I do? Should I return the money?	The situation you are facing is indeed complex and requires careful consideration of your legal obligations as a director and the potential consequences of the liquidator's actions. Here are some points to consider based on relevant statutes and case law: 1. **Director's Duties**: Under the Companies Act 2006, particularly section 172, you have a duty to act in the best interests of the company, taking into account the interests of its creditors when the company is insolvent or bordering on insolvency. If it can be shown that the company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due (a cash flow insolvency, as outlined in Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)) or that its assets were less than its liabilities (balance sheet insolvency), the liquidator could argue that you breached these duties. 2. **Misfeasance Claims**: As seen in HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch), a liquidator can bring a misfeasance claim under section 212 of the Insolvency Act 1986 against directors if they believe directors have misapplied company money or breached their duties, resulting in the company’s assets being diminished improperly. 3. **Loan and Repayments**: Even if the loan terms were below market rate, if repayments were made when the company was insolvent and not in the best interest of the creditors, this could be seen as preferential treatment. The liquidator might argue that you should have ceased repayments or that these payments constituted a transaction at an undervalue, which could be voidable (as seen in Casa Estates (UK) Ltd case law). 4. **Risk of Disqualification**: Under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, if it is found that you were unfit to manage the company due to misconduct, you risk being disqualified, which would affect your position in your sister's company. 5. **Defense and Legal Strategy**: - Gather evidence to support that you acted reasonably and in good faith, considering the company's financial situation and the fairness of the transactions. - Consider repaying the amounts to avoid further litigation if it is financially feasible and could mitigate the risk of misfeasance or disqualification claims. - Seek early legal advice to potentially negotiate a settlement with the liquidator to mitigate the risk of being pursued for misfeasance or facing a disqualification order. 6. **Next Steps**: - Engage with an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor experienced in insolvency law to discuss your specific circumstances and defenses. - Review all available documentation and communications related to the loan and the company's financial status during the repayments to build your case. Given the implications for your ability to serve as a director, taking proactive steps and seeking professional legal guidance is crucial.	8.021796703338623	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 108 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 91 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 6.23 (CREDITORS' VOLUNTARY WINDING UP)	HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch) (Cash flows; Notion of insolvency; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidators' powers and duties; Misfeasance; Payments in insolvency)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Centralcrest Engineering Ltd, Re [1999] 9 W.L.U.K. 176 (Misconduct; Liquidators' duties; Misfeasance; Tortious liability; Trading)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.)

Q9	My business is operating at a loss. Chase Bank is my major lender, and they have a security over my home. I fell into arrears towards several suppliers, but I do believe I can turn around my business if I am given a bit more time to repay my debts. What can I do?	Given your situation, it's important to handle the financial difficulties carefully, especially considering the security Chase Bank has over your home and the arrears with suppliers. Here are some steps and considerations based on relevant legal principles and statutes: ### 1. **Assess Your Current Financial Position:** - **Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Tests:** Refer to the principles from *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)* and *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383*. Conducting both cash flow and balance sheet tests can help determine whether your company is insolvent, which affects your options and obligations. If a company can't pay its debts as they fall due, or if liabilities exceed assets (considering prospective and contingent liabilities), it may be deemed insolvent (Insolvency Act 1986, s.123). ### 2. **Negotiate with Chase Bank and Suppliers:** - Open discussions with Chase Bank regarding your arrears and see if a temporary reprieve can be negotiated. This may involve restructuring the loan or obtaining a payment holiday. - Similarly, approach your suppliers to negotiate payment terms. Demonstrating your business plans for recovery may encourage cooperation. ### 3. **Consider Formal Restructuring Options:** - **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** A CVA allows a company to agree on a payment plan with creditors. It may be suitable if you believe the business is viable in the long term. - **Moratorium:** Investigate if a moratorium under the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 might temporarily protect the company from legal action. This can allow time to restructure or find new financing. ### 4. **Directors' Duties and Responsibilities:** - Per *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)*, ensure you are acting in good faith and in the interests of creditors. Wrongful trading should be avoided as per guidance from *Re Pure Zanzibar Ltd [2022] EWHC 971 (Ch)*. ### 5. **Legal Protection and Insolvency Options:** - **Insolvency Act 1986, s.124:** Understand the circumstances under which winding-up petitions might be filed, and actively manage creditor relationships to prevent such actions. - Consider seeking advice on whether giving up security (per Insolvency Act 1986, s.269) is a possibility to improve negotiations with Chase Bank. ### 6. **Explore the Possibility of Business Closure:** - If recovery isn't feasible, you might consider closing or liquidating the company. Use Companies House Form DS01 to apply for a voluntary strike-off if applicable. ### Documentation: - **Companies House Form MT03:** If any moratorium is planned, this form is necessary to inform Companies House if the moratorium ends early. It's advisable to consult with an insolvency practitioner or a legal professional to get a detailed analysis and personalized assistance, especially considering the potential for personal and senior debt liabilities due to the secured nature of the loan over your home.	7.521384239196777	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 269 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Companies Act 2006 section 226C (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 224 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)	"Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q10	My business went into liquidation last March. I tried my best to avoid it. I may have preferred some creditors over others, but simply because they knew I was struggling, and they would not give me their products on credit. I may also have taken some money out of the business account to repay the mortgage on my house. Surely, I did nothing wrong? Do I risk anything?	In the context of your business going into liquidation, there are several considerations under UK insolvency law that you should be aware of: 1. **Preference of Creditors**: Under the Insolvency Act 1986, transactions that unfairly prefer one creditor over others may be challenged by a liquidator. If you paid certain creditors to the detriment of others, knowing that the company was insolvent, this can potentially lead to those transactions being set aside. However, the intent behind the preference and whether you acted in good faith will be relevant factors to consider. 2. **Transactions at an Undervalue**: Taking money out of the business account to repay a personal mortgage could be scrutinized under the Insolvency Act 1986 as a transaction at an undervalue. If the company did not receive adequate consideration in return, a liquidator may seek to recover these funds. The case of *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383* supports the view that both balance sheet and cash flow insolvency assessments need to be made in such scenarios. 3. **Directors' Duties**: As a director, you owe fiduciary duties to the company, including considering creditors' interests when the company is on the verge of insolvency, as highlighted in *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)*. Breaching these duties can result in personal liability. 4. **Wrongful Trading**: Directors should be mindful of wrongful trading provisions. If you continued to trade while the business was insolvent, knowing that there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvency, you could be held personally liable for increasing the company’s debts. 5. **Director Disqualification**: The Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 provides grounds for disqualification if a director's conduct falls short, such as not being able to meet fiduciary obligations or being involved in preferential or undervalue transactions. 6. **Good Faith and Intention**: The principle established in the case of *Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38* considers whether transactions were conducted in good faith and without the intention to evade insolvency laws. You should consider seeking legal advice from a corporate insolvency lawyer to precisely assess your situation and evaluate any potential risks. They can also assist you with any necessary forms, such as Companies House Form LIQ02 for the statement of affairs, if required.	11.095733165740967	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 188 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 247 (Interpretation for First Group of Parts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Marches Credit Union Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 1731 (Ch) (Liquidation; Locus standi; Petitions; Union)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form LIQ06: Use this form to give notice of a liquidator's resignation in members' voluntary liquidation or creditors' voluntary liquidation.|Companies House Form AM22: Use this form to give notice of a move from administration to creditors' voluntary liquidation.
Q11	My life-long partner just left me for an Italian scugnizzo who is 15 years younger than her. What’s worse is that before leaving, she emptied our joint business account and she stopped paying the joint mortgage we have on our business. The bank is threatening legal actions against me, and to foreclose on the business property. What can I do? By the way, I cannot contact my (ex) partner but I believe she’s now in Italy with her new partner.	I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Given the circumstances, it’s crucial to take immediate legal action to protect your interests and the business. Here are some steps and considerations you might take, keeping in mind the legal framework in England: 1. **Assessment of Insolvency**: - You should assess if the business is facing insolvency as defined under the Insolvency Act 1986. According to sections such as s.123, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it cannot meet its liabilities as they fall due. The case *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2)* suggests considering both current and prospective debts using cash-flow and balance-sheet tests, as reinforced in *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd*. 2. **Legal Actions against the Ex-Partner**: - If your ex-partner's actions involved misconduct or transactions at an undervalue, consider pursuing legal action to potentially recover the funds. *Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice* might provide insight into actions taken without authority or that resulted in undervalue transactions. - You may also need to consider any breach of fiduciary duties if she had a management or director role, especially related to directors' duties of good faith under the Companies Act 2006, s.172, as discussed in *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA*. 3. **Protecting the Business Assets**: - If the business is at risk of insolvency or already insolvent, consider engaging an insolvency practitioner for advice on administration or a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to protect its assets from immediate foreclosure by the bank. - You may also examine if foreign proceedings are necessary if she's moved assets abroad, considering regulations similar to *Re Entertainment Ltd*. 4. **Communication and Negotiation with the Bank**: - Open a line of communication with the bank to negotiate potential deferments or modifications to the loan terms, showing a plan to rebuild business solvency or recover stolen assets. 5. **Legal Assistance and Reporting the Crime**: - Engage a solicitor with expertise in fraud and corporate insolvency to help ascertain any potential personal liabilities and ensure proceedings properly address both corporate and personal impacts. - Consider reporting the theft to the police, as her actions may constitute criminal wrongdoing, especially if there are elements of fraud. 6. **Cross-border Considerations**: - If your ex-partner is in Italy, you may need to pursue international legal assistance, especially if you intend to recover assets relocated cross-border, referencing applicable treaties or regulations. 7. **Documenting Everything**: - Keep a detailed record of all communications, transactions, and relevant documentation about the business, your partner, and bank dealings. By taking these steps and seeking appropriate legal support, you can work towards mitigating the impact on your business and personal financial situation.	6.313218593597412	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251R (Debt relief orders)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 365 (Bankruptcy)	Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice [1995] 1 W.L.R. 1238 (Directors' duties and powers; Misconduct; Transactions at an undervalue)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Re Entertainment Ltd [2016] EWHC 1545 (Ch) (Cross-Border Insolvency; Centre of main interests; Cross-border insolvency; Foreign proceedings)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form DS01: Use this service to apply to strike off a company from the Companies House register.

Q12	After Brexit, I set up a business in the Netherlands. This is a limited liability company. I am the sole director of that company. There are no employees in the Netherlands, just some people I hire occasionally to load and unload the lorries that distribute my products to the rest of Europe. I have now decided to stop selling goods to Europe, because it is not profitable. I want to wind-up the business here in the UK. Can I do it?	To wind up a business in the UK, it is important to consider where the company is established and the procedures applicable to that jurisdiction. Given that your business is a limited liability company set up in the Netherlands, the winding-up process primarily falls under Dutch law. However, if there are aspects in the UK you need to address, here’s a general overview and guidance using relevant UK legal principles and procedures that may overlap: 1. **Dutch Legal Considerations**: - As your company is established in the Netherlands, you should consult a local legal expert who can guide you through the Dutch insolvency and company laws applicable to winding up your business there. 2. **UK Considerations**: - If your company holds assets, has liabilities, or conducts activities in the UK, certain aspects may be influenced by UK regulations. It's essential to examine any UK-based obligations or liabilities that may arise during the winding-up process. 3. **Limited Liability and Piercing the Corporate Veil**: - The principle of limited liability, as affirmed in Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34, means that, generally, your personal assets are protected from the company's liabilities unless there are exceptional circumstances warranting the piercing of the corporate veil. 4. **Director’s Duties**: - As a director, you have fiduciary duties to consider under UK law (Insolvency Act 1986), which include acting in the best interests of creditors as you approach insolvency. McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) highlights the importance of adhering to these duties to avoid misfeasance claims. 5. **UK Insolvency Procedures**: - If the company has duties or properties linked to the UK, you might need to explore UK insolvency procedures, like administration or liquidation, regarding these assets or liabilities. 6. **Statements and Notices**: - Should there be any charges on property in the UK, use Companies House forms like Form MR06 to register statements concerning these charges. - Ensure proper notifications if discontinuing business activities, considering any requirements under the Companies Act 2006. 7. **No Employees**: - With no direct employees in the Netherlands, winding up is simplified compared to businesses with employees, thus reducing any obligations relating to employees during the liquidation process. Engaging with both Dutch and UK legal professionals would provide you with a comprehensive approach, ensuring both jurisdictions’ requirements are met during the winding-up of your business. Additionally, consider any cross-border implications and the structuring of your assets and liabilities to ensure a smooth transition and cessation of business operations.	6.447741270065308	1	Companies Act 2006 section 3 (General introductory provisions)|Companies Act 2006 section 58 (A company's name)|Companies Act 2006 section 59 (A company's name)	Bristol Airport Plc v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744 (Administration; Liens; Security)|Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34 (Piercing the corporate veil; Limited liability)|McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)	Companies House Form IC01: Us this form to give notice of the intention to carry on business as an investment company.|Companies House Form RR02: This form is for public companies to re-register as a private limited company.|Companies House Form MR06: Use this form to register a statement of a company acting as a trustee after a charge created on or after 6 April 2013 has been registered.
