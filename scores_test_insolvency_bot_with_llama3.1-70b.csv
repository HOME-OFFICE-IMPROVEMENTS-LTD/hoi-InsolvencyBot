Q1	I set up a limited liability company in 2015. My business suffered greatly during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it still hasn’t recovered yet. I fell into arrears, and one of my suppliers submitted a winding-up petition against my business. A friend of mine is willing to invest money in my company. Do I have good chances of avoiding a liquidation order if my friend commits to pumping money into my business?	I can provide you with some general guidance on the situation you're facing. However, please note that this is not a substitute for personalized advice from a qualified insolvency lawyer. Given that your business has been struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic and you've fallen into arrears, it's not surprising that a supplier has submitted a winding-up petition against your company. However, with a potential investor willing to pump money into your business, you may have a chance to avoid a liquidation order. To assess your chances, let's consider the relevant law and case law. In Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch), the court held that a company must show that COVID-19 had a significant impact on its business to prevent a winding-up petition. Since your business has been struggling due to the pandemic, you may be able to argue that COVID-19 has had an adverse financial effect on your company. However, the court will also consider whether the investment from your friend is sufficient to pay off the debts and whether the company is still viable. In Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch), the court held that the test of commercial or cash-flow insolvency does not exclude consideration of prospective or future debts. This means that the court will consider not only your current debts but also any potential future debts. In Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131, the court dismissed a winding-up petition where the petitioner failed to show that the company would have been wound up even if COVID-19 had not had an adverse financial effect on the company. This suggests that if your friend's investment can help you pay off your debts and make your business viable again, you may be able to avoid a liquidation order. To increase your chances of avoiding a liquidation order, you should: 1. Provide evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on your business, including financial statements and expert reports. 2. Show that the investment from your friend is sufficient to pay off your debts and make your business viable again. 3. Demonstrate that you have a viable business plan in place to ensure the company's future success. 4. Consider filing a notice of intention to appoint an administrator (using Companies House Form MT03) to give you some breathing space to restructure your business. 5. Be prepared to negotiate with your supplier and other creditors to reach a settlement or payment plan. It's essential to seek advice from a qualified insolvency lawyer to help you navigate this complex situation. They can assist you in preparing the necessary documents, negotiating with creditors, and representing you in court. Additionally, you may want to consider the following Companies House forms: * Companies House Form LIQ03: Use this form to give notice of progress report in voluntary winding up. * Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early. * Companies House Form WU07: Use this form to give notice of a progress report in a winding-up by the court.

Q2	My business has been running at a deficit for a few years. In 2021, I got a loan from NatWest to stay afloat. I have given my share in the family home (50%) as a collateral for this loan. I am now unable to repay it. What should I do? Can the bank repossess my house?	I can see that you are in a difficult situation. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I would advise you to take immediate action to address the situation. Firstly, it is essential to understand that the bank can repossess your house if you fail to repay the loan. As you have given your share in the family home (50%) as collateral for the loan, the bank has a secured interest in the property. If you default on the loan, the bank can exercise its right to repossess the property to recover the debt. However, before taking any drastic measures, I would recommend that you consider the following options: 1. Communicate with the bank: Reach out to the bank and explain your situation. They may be willing to work with you to find a solution, such as restructuring the loan or providing temporary relief. 2. Seek professional advice: Consult with a financial advisor or an insolvency practitioner to explore options for managing your debt and avoiding repossession. 3. Consider a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA): If your business is viable, you may be able to propose a CVA to your creditors, including the bank. This could allow you to restructure your debt and avoid liquidation. 4. Look into alternative funding options: You may be able to secure alternative funding to pay off the loan and avoid repossession. It is also essential to understand your duties as a director and the potential consequences of failing to address the situation. As a director, you have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. If you fail to address the situation, you may be held personally liable for any losses incurred by the company. In the case of McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch), the court held that the drawings made by the respondents on account of anticipated profits amounted to misfeasance and a breach of fiduciary duty. This highlights the importance of acting in the best interests of the company and its creditors. In terms of the bank's ability to repossess your house, it is essential to understand the terms of the loan agreement and the security provided. If the bank has a valid security interest in the property, they may be able to repossess the property to recover the debt. In conclusion, I would strongly advise you to seek professional advice and take immediate action to address the situation. It is essential to communicate with the bank, explore alternative funding options, and consider a CVA or other restructuring options to avoid repossession and potential personal liability. Please note that this is not a substitute for professional advice, and you should consult with a qualified insolvency practitioner or financial advisor to discuss your specific situation and options.

Q3	My business (a small restaurant in Egham) is saddled with debt towards several suppliers. I do have a loyal customer base, but I feel that I need to reduce my debt burden. My brother offered to buy my business for a fair price, and he also told me he would like to retain me and some of my employees. However, he says that I need to deal with my debt before selling the business to him. I don’t have savings. What can I do?	I understand your situation, and I'm here to provide you with some guidance. Given your debt burden and the offer from your brother, it's essential to consider your options carefully. Firstly, it's crucial to assess your company's financial situation and determine whether it's insolvent. Insolvency can be determined by either the cash flow test (Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)) or the balance sheet test (Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383). If your company is insolvent, you may need to consider formal insolvency procedures. Since you don't have savings, you may want to explore options to reduce your debt burden. One possibility is to negotiate with your suppliers to see if they can offer any concessions or payment plans. However, if this is not feasible, you may need to consider more formal debt restructuring options. Your brother's offer to buy the business and retain you and some employees is a positive development. However, as he has mentioned, dealing with the debt burden is essential before the sale. You may want to consider seeking professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor to help you navigate this process. In terms of formal insolvency procedures, you may want to consider a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) or an Administration. A CVA would allow you to propose a repayment plan to your creditors, while an Administration would provide a moratorium on creditor action, allowing you to restructure the business. It's also essential to consider your duties as a director, particularly in relation to your creditors. You have a duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors (BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)). If you're unsure about your duties or the best course of action, it's recommended that you seek professional advice. In terms of the sale of the business, you'll need to ensure that the transaction is conducted in a way that complies with the relevant laws and regulations. You may want to consider seeking advice from a solicitor to ensure that the sale is structured correctly and that all necessary documentation is in place. To give notice of a statement of affairs, you can use Companies House Form LIQ02. If you need to register a charge to secure a series of debentures, you can use Companies House Form MR03. If you need to apply to Companies House to get your company restored, you can use Companies House Form RT01. In conclusion, it's essential to seek professional advice to determine the best course of action for your business. You should consider your options carefully and ensure that you're complying with all relevant laws and regulations. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of options, and you should seek professional advice before making any decisions.	167.93873190879822	2	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 149 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q4	I own a pub in Windsor. I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, by additional taxes on alcohol as well as by a reduction in my customer base. I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). I reached an agreement with my bank and with most of my suppliers to delay the repayment of my debt. The HMRC won’t listen and they are threatening legal actions against me. What can I do? HMRC counts for roughly 50% of my unsecured debt (the debt towards the bank is secured by a collateral on my pub).	I can see that you're facing a challenging situation with your pub business in Windsor. Given the circumstances, I would recommend that you consider the following options: 1. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: A CVA is a procedure that allows a company to reach a binding agreement with its creditors to pay off a proportion of its debts over time. This could be a viable option for you, as it would allow you to restructure your debts and avoid liquidation. However, you would need to demonstrate that the CVA is in the best interests of your creditors and that you have a viable business plan in place. 2. **Administration**: If a CVA is not feasible, you may want to consider entering into administration. This would involve appointing an administrator to take control of your business and negotiate with your creditors. The administrator would have the power to sell off assets, reduce debts, and restructure your business to make it more viable. 3. **Moratorium**: You may be eligible for a moratorium, which would provide you with a temporary breathing space to restructure your debts and avoid creditor action. A moratorium can be obtained through the court or by agreement with your creditors. 4. **Negotiation with HMRC**: It's worth trying to negotiate with HMRC to see if they can offer any assistance or flexibility. They may be willing to accept a payment plan or temporarily suspend enforcement action. 5. **Seeking professional advice**: I would strongly recommend that you seek the advice of a qualified insolvency practitioner or a solicitor who specializes in insolvency law. They can help you navigate the options available to you and provide guidance on the best course of action. In terms of the relevant statutes and case law, the following may be applicable: * Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38: This case highlights the importance of good faith and commercial sense in the application of the anti-deprivation principle. * Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch): This case provides guidance on the notion of insolvency and the importance of considering both cash flow and balance sheet tests. * Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131: This case demonstrates the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on insolvency law and the need for flexibility in dealing with creditors. * Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383: This case highlights the importance of considering both cash flow and balance sheet tests when determining insolvency. * Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA): This case provides guidance on the notion of insolvency and the importance of considering the company's ability to pay its debts. * BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch): This case highlights the importance of good faith and fiduciary duty in the context of insolvency. * BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28: This case provides guidance on the notion of insolvency and the importance of considering both cash flow and balance sheet tests. * Companies House Form MT09: This form is used to notify Companies House of a monitor ceasing to act following a court order. * Companies House Form MT02: This form is used to notify Companies House of an extension to a moratorium for a company. * Companies House Form MT03: This form is used to notify Companies House that a moratorium has ended early. * Insolvency Act 1986 section A28: This section provides guidance on the moratorium and the restrictions on creditor action during this period. * Companies Act 2006 section 899A: This section provides guidance on arrangements and reconstructions, including the use of CVAs. * Insolvency Act 1986 section 124: This section provides guidance on the winding up of companies and the grounds for doing so. * Insolvency Act 1986 section 123: This section provides guidance on the notion of insolvency and the tests for determining insolvency. * Insolvency Act 1986 section 251G: This section provides guidance on debt relief orders and the moratorium that applies during this period.

Q5	I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, as well as by a reduction in my customer base (I run a pub in Ascot). I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). My landlord is demanding an extortionate amount of money for my rent. While I agreed to a new, 5-year leasing agreement, I realised that I am operating at a loss unless my rent is reduced and the HMRC agrees to a repayment plan. What can I do?	I can see that you're facing a challenging situation with your pub business in Ascot. Given the rise in interest rates and the reduction in your customer base, it's not surprising that you're struggling to make ends meet. Firstly, I would recommend that you seek professional advice from an accountant or a financial advisor to help you assess your financial situation and identify areas where you can cut costs and improve your cash flow. Regarding your arrears with HMRC, I would suggest that you contact them as soon as possible to discuss a repayment plan. HMRC may be willing to work with you to set up a payment plan that takes into account your current financial situation. You can also consider seeking advice from a tax advisor or a debt management company to help you navigate this process. In terms of your suppliers, it's good that you've been able to pay some of them in full to avoid disrupting your business. However, you may want to consider negotiating with your suppliers to see if they can offer you any discounts or payment terms that can help you manage your cash flow. Regarding your landlord's demand for an extortionate amount of rent, I would recommend that you seek advice from a commercial property lawyer to help you negotiate a more reasonable rent. You may also want to consider seeking mediation or arbitration to resolve the dispute. In terms of your options for dealing with your debt, you may want to consider the following: 1. Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA): This is a procedure that allows you to propose a repayment plan to your creditors, which can help you avoid liquidation. 2. Administration: This is a procedure that allows you to appoint an administrator to take control of your business and negotiate with your creditors. 3. Liquidation: This is a procedure that involves winding up your business and selling off its assets to pay off your creditors. It's worth noting that the anti-deprivation principle, as established in Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38, may be relevant in your situation. This principle holds that a company cannot avoid its debts by entering into a contract that deprives its creditors of their rights. Additionally, the case of BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) may be relevant in terms of your duties as a director. This case established that directors have a duty to act in the best interests of the company, but also have a duty to consider the interests of creditors when the company is insolvent. In terms of the Companies House forms, you may need to file a Form LIQ03 to give notice of a progress report in voluntary winding up, or a Form RT01 to apply to Companies House to get your company restored.

Q6	I am a real estate developer. Due to the current housing crisis, my mortgages have ballooned, and I am struggling to make money out of the sale of the properties I recently completed. While my housing portfolio is significant, most properties are not yet ready for the market. I am not paying all my suppliers, and the banks are chasing me multiple times per day. If they foreclose, I lose everything. If I complete all my projects, I can repay the banks and the suppliers. However, one of them just filed a petition for winding up my business. I refuse to believe I am insolvent. Is it likely that the petition will be dismissed?	I understand your concerns as a real estate developer facing financial difficulties. However, the fact that you are not paying all your suppliers and the banks are chasing you multiple times a day raises concerns about your company's solvency. In the UK, a company is deemed insolvent if it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (Insolvency Act 1986, section 123). The court may also consider the value of the company's assets compared to its liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities (Insolvency Act 1986, section 123). Given that one of your suppliers has filed a petition for winding up your business, the court will likely consider the following factors: 1. Your company's ability to pay its debts as they fall due (Insolvency Act 1986, section 123). 2. The value of your company's assets compared to its liabilities (Insolvency Act 1986, section 123). 3. The likelihood of your company completing its projects and repaying its debts (Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch)). To challenge the winding-up petition, you may need to provide evidence that your company is not insolvent, such as: 1. A detailed financial statement showing that your company's assets exceed its liabilities. 2. A plan to complete your projects and repay your debts. 3. Evidence that the supplier who filed the petition is not a creditor in good faith (Rushbrooke UK Ltd v 4 Design Concepts Ltd [2022] EWHC 1110 (Ch)). However, if the court finds that your company is insolvent, it may grant the winding-up petition, and your business may be wound up. In light of the current situation, I would recommend that you: 1. Seek professional advice from an insolvency lawyer to assess your company's financial situation and advise on the best course of action. 2. Consider filing a moratorium application under Insolvency Act 1986, section A4, to temporarily halt the winding-up proceedings and allow your company to restructure its debts. 3. Prepare a detailed financial statement and a plan to complete your projects and repay your debts to present to the court. Please note that the above advice is general and not specific to your situation. I recommend seeking professional advice from an insolvency lawyer to get a more accurate assessment of your company's financial situation and the best course of action. Additionally, you may want to consider the following Companies House forms: * Companies House Form WU07: Use this form to give notice of a progress report in a winding-up by the court. * Companies House Form DS02: Use this form to withdraw your company's striking off application. * Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.

Q7	My brother and I have been working together on our hand-made furniture shop for 20+ years. Last year, we had to liquidate the business because we could no longer pay the bills. An official receiver was appointed. Yesterday, he came back to us and asked to repay all the dividends we received in the 5 years before insolvency. This is a ridiculous amount of money (£150,000 each). My brother and I never received a salary. The official receiver says that we could not get any dividends because the business was operating at a loss. We were only paid in dividends to avoid income tax, and because my accountant told me that was fine. Surely, we don’t have to repay that money?	"I can see that you and your brother are in a difficult situation. The official receiver is seeking to recover £150,000 from each of you, which is a significant amount. The official receiver's claim is based on the fact that the company was operating at a loss, and therefore, the dividends you received in the 5 years leading up to the insolvency were not legitimate. However, you and your brother never received a salary, and the dividends were paid to avoid income tax, as advised by your accountant. In this situation, it's essential to consider the concept of ""transactions at an undervalue"" under the Insolvency Act 1986. This concept allows the official receiver to challenge transactions that were entered into by the company in the 2 years leading up to the insolvency, where the company received no consideration or inadequate consideration. However, in your case, the dividends were paid over a 5-year period, and it's not clear whether the official receiver can challenge these transactions as being at an undervalue. It's also worth considering the concept of ""good faith"" and whether you and your brother acted in good faith when receiving the dividends. If you can demonstrate that you acted in good faith and had no knowledge of the company's financial difficulties, it may be possible to argue that the dividends were not improper. In the case of Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38, the Supreme Court held that commercial sense and the absence of intention to evade insolvency laws were highly relevant factors in the application of the anti-deprivation principle. This case may be relevant to your situation, as it suggests that the court will consider the commercial context and the intentions of the parties when determining whether a transaction is improper. In terms of the relevant statute, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 provides that a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities. This section may be relevant to your situation, as it suggests that the company was insolvent at the time the dividends were paid. The Companies Act 2006 section 172 provides that a director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. This section may be relevant to your situation, as it suggests that you and your brother, as directors, had a duty to act in the best interests of the company. In terms of case law, the case of Re City Build (London) Ltd (in liq.) [2022] EWHC 364 (Ch) may be relevant to your situation. In this case, the court considered the concept of ""transactions at an undervalue"" and the role of the official receiver in challenging such transactions. In conclusion, while the official receiver's claim is significant, it's essential to consider the commercial context and the intentions of the parties when determining whether the dividends were improper. It's also crucial to consider the relevant statute and case law, including the concept of ""good faith"" and ""transactions at an undervalue."" I would recommend seeking the advice of a qualified insolvency lawyer to help navigate this complex situation."	329.7158131599426	3	Insolvency Act 1986 section 399 (Public Administration (England and Wales))|Insolvency Act 1986 section 132 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 13.2 (OFFICIAL RECEIVER)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q8	My business went into liquidation last year. I was the owner and director. A liquidator was appointed. He is threatening to sue me for breaching my duties as a director unless I return the money I received as monthly repayments for a loan I gave to my company. He’s also threatening to start a disqualification procedure against me for the same reason. I believe I did nothing wrong – this was a fair loan with interests below the market rate. However, I cannot risk being disqualified, because I am also working as a director in my sister’s company. What can I do? Should I return the money?	I understand your concerns and the potential risks you're facing. As a director, you have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. The liquidator's allegations of breaching your duties as a director and potential disqualification proceedings are serious matters that require careful consideration. Firstly, it's essential to understand the context of the loan and the repayments you received. If the loan was made at a below-market interest rate, it may be considered a transaction at an undervalue, which could be challenged by the liquidator under the Insolvency Act 1986, section 238. However, if the loan was made in good faith and with the intention of supporting the company, it may be possible to defend the transaction. Regarding the repayments, if they were made in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and were not preferential payments, it's possible to argue that they were legitimate. However, if the repayments were made at a time when the company was insolvent or on the verge of insolvency, the liquidator may argue that they were made in breach of your duties as a director. In light of the potential risks, it's crucial to take a cautious approach. Returning the money may not necessarily resolve the issue, as the liquidator may still pursue disqualification proceedings. However, it may be a way to demonstrate your willingness to cooperate and potentially mitigate the situation. Before making any decisions, I recommend that you: 1. Seek professional advice from a solicitor specializing in insolvency law to review the loan agreement, the repayments, and the company's financial records. 2. Provide your solicitor with all relevant documentation, including the loan agreement, repayment records, and any correspondence with the liquidator. 3. Consider responding to the liquidator's allegations in writing, denying any wrongdoing and providing evidence to support your position. 4. Be prepared to negotiate with the liquidator to potentially settle the matter or agree on a payment plan. 5. If necessary, be prepared to defend yourself in court against any disqualification proceedings. Relevant statutes and case law to consider: * Insolvency Act 1986, sections 123, 238, and 239 * Companies Act 2006, sections 172 and 174 * Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, sections 1-7 * HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch) * Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) * Centralcrest Engineering Ltd, Re [1999] 9 W.L.U.K. 176 * Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 * Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.)

Q9	My business is operating at a loss. Chase Bank is my major lender, and they have a security over my home. I fell into arrears towards several suppliers, but I do believe I can turn around my business if I am given a bit more time to repay my debts. What can I do?	I understand your situation, and I'm here to provide you with some guidance. Given that your business is operating at a loss and you have a security over your home with Chase Bank, it's essential to address the situation promptly to avoid any further complications. Firstly, I would recommend that you seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in corporate insolvency. They can help you assess your company's financial situation and provide guidance on the best course of action. Considering your situation, you may want to explore the following options: 1. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: A CVA is a formal agreement between your company and its creditors to pay off debts over time. This can help you avoid liquidation and give you more time to repay your debts. However, you will need to demonstrate that your company is viable and can recover with the proposed arrangement. 2. **Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)**: If you are personally liable for the debts, an IVA might be an option. This is a formal agreement between you and your creditors to pay off debts over time. However, this will not affect the security over your home. 3. **Time to Pay Arrangement**: You can approach HMRC and your suppliers to negotiate a Time to Pay Arrangement, which allows you to pay off debts over a longer period. 4. **Refinancing or Restructuring**: You may want to explore refinancing or restructuring options with Chase Bank or other lenders to reduce your debt burden. It's essential to note that the court's decision in Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) emphasizes that the test of commercial or cash-flow insolvency does not exclude consideration of prospective or future debts. This means that the court will consider not only your current financial situation but also your future prospects when determining whether your company is insolvent. Additionally, the case of Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 highlights the importance of considering the impact of coronavirus on a company's financial situation when determining insolvency. In terms of the security over your home, it's crucial to understand that Chase Bank can enforce this security if you default on your payments. However, you may be able to negotiate with the bank to temporarily suspend or reduce payments. To avoid any further complications, I recommend that you: 1. Seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in corporate insolvency. 2. Communicate with your creditors, including Chase Bank, to negotiate a payment plan or temporary suspension of payments. 3. Explore refinancing or restructuring options to reduce your debt burden. 4. Consider a CVA or IVA, if applicable, to formalize a payment plan with your creditors. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the best course of action will depend on your specific circumstances. I strongly advise you to seek professional advice to ensure you make informed decisions about your company's future.

Q10	My business went into liquidation last March. I tried my best to avoid it.

They can help you assess your company's financial situation and provide guidance on the best course of action. Considering your situation, you may want to explore the following options: 1. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: A CVA is a formal agreement between your company and its creditors to pay off debts over time. This can help you avoid liquidation and give you more time to repay your debts. However, you will need to demonstrate that your company is viable and can recover with the proposed arrangement. 2. **Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)**: If you are personally liable for the debts, an IVA might be an option. This is a formal agreement between you and your creditors to pay off debts over time. However, this will not affect the security over your home. 3. **Time to Pay Arrangement**: You can approach HMRC and your suppliers to negotiate a Time to Pay Arrangement, which allows you to pay off debts over a longer period. 4. **Refinancing or Restructuring**: You may want to explore refinancing or restructuring options with Chase Bank or other lenders to reduce your debt burden. It's essential to note that the court's decision in Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) emphasizes that the test of commercial or cash-flow insolvency does not exclude consideration of prospective or future debts. This means that the court will consider not only your current financial situation but also your future prospects when determining whether your company is insolvent. Additionally, the case of Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 highlights the importance of considering the impact of coronavirus on a company's financial situation when determining insolvency. In terms of the security over your home, it's crucial to understand that Chase Bank can enforce this security if you default on your payments. However, you may be able to negotiate with the bank to temporarily suspend or reduce payments. To avoid any further complications, I recommend that you: 1. Seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in corporate insolvency. 2. Communicate with your creditors, including Chase Bank, to negotiate a payment plan or temporary suspension of payments. 3. Explore refinancing or restructuring options to reduce your debt burden. 4. Consider a CVA or IVA, if applicable, to formalize a payment plan with your creditors. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and the best course of action will depend on your specific circumstances. I strongly advise you to seek professional advice to ensure you make informed decisions about your company's future.

Q11	My life-long partner just left me for an Italian scugnizzo who is 15 years younger than her. What’s worse is that before leaving, she emptied our joint business account and she stopped paying the joint mortgage we have on our business. The bank is threatening legal actions against me, and to foreclose on the business property. What can I do? By the way, I cannot contact my (ex) partner but I believe she’s now in Italy with her new partner.	I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. Given the circumstances, it's essential to act quickly to protect your interests and the business. Here's a step-by-step plan to help you navigate this challenging situation: 1. **Seek professional advice**: Consult with a solicitor specializing in corporate insolvency, family law, and international law. They will help you understand your options and create a strategy to address the situation. 2. **Assess the business's financial situation**: Review the company's financial records to determine its current financial position, including any outstanding debts, assets, and liabilities. This will help you understand the potential risks and consequences of the situation. 3. **Contact the bank**: Reach out to the bank and explain the situation. They may be willing to work with you to find a solution, such as a temporary payment arrangement or a restructuring plan. Be prepared to provide financial information and a plan to address the outstanding mortgage payments. 4. **Consider a winding-up petition**: If the business is insolvent, you may need to consider presenting a winding-up petition to the court. This would allow you to take control of the company's assets and liabilities, potentially preventing further financial damage. (Insolvency Act 1986, section 124) 5. **Freeze the joint business account**: If possible, try to freeze the joint business account to prevent any further transactions. This may require a court order or an agreement with the bank. 6. **Pursue your ex-partner**: Although you cannot contact your ex-partner directly, you may be able to pursue her through the Italian courts or by working with a lawyer specializing in international law. This could help you recover some of the funds taken from the joint business account. 7. **Review your director's duties**: As a director of the company, you have fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. Ensure you are fulfilling these duties by taking steps to address the situation and protect the company's assets. (Companies Act 2006, section 154) 8. **Consider a moratorium**: If the company is facing financial difficulties, you may be able to apply for a moratorium to give you time to restructure the business or find a solution. (Insolvency Act 1986, section 251R) 9. **Keep Companies House informed**: Update Companies House about the situation, including any changes to the company's directors, shareholders, or financial situation. (Companies House Form DS01, DS02, or MT03) 10. **Be prepared for potential consequences**: Depending on the outcome, you may face personal liability for the company's debts or be subject to disqualification as a director.

Q12	After Brexit, I set up a business in the Netherlands. This is a limited liability company. I am the sole director of that company. There are no employees in the Netherlands, just some people I hire occasionally to load and unload the lorries that distribute my products to the rest of Europe. I have now decided to stop selling goods to Europe, because it is not profitable. I want to wind-up the business here in the UK. Can I do it?	I can't provide legal advice, but I can offer some general guidance. You are the sole director of a limited liability company in the Netherlands, and you wish to wind up the business in the UK. However, it appears that the company is registered in the Netherlands, not the UK. To wind up the company, you will need to follow the relevant Dutch insolvency laws and procedures. You may need to consult with a Dutch lawyer or insolvency practitioner to determine the best course of action. If you have any assets or liabilities in the UK, you may need to consider the UK's insolvency laws and procedures as well. However, the primary focus will be on the Dutch company and the Dutch insolvency laws. In the UK, the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 would typically govern the winding-up process. However, since the company is registered in the Netherlands, these laws may not apply directly. As the sole director, you have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. You should ensure that you follow the proper procedures and seek professional advice to avoid any potential liabilities or claims. It's also worth noting that the UK's Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 may still apply to you as a director, even if the company is registered in the Netherlands. This law allows the court to disqualify a director from acting as a director of any UK company if they are found to be unfit. In terms of relevant case law, Bristol Airport Plc v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744 may be relevant if there are any security interests or liens on the company's assets. Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34 may also be relevant if there are any issues related to piercing the corporate veil or limited liability. McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) may be relevant if there are any issues related to breach of fiduciary duty or misfeasance. Companies House forms, such as Form IC01, Form RR02, and Form MR06, are not directly relevant to the winding-up process in the Netherlands. However, if you have any UK-registered companies or assets, these forms may be relevant. I recommend seeking professional advice from a Dutch lawyer or insolvency practitioner to ensure that you follow the proper procedures and comply with the relevant laws and regulations.	166.9047653675079	2	Companies Act 2006 section 3 (General introductory provisions)|Companies Act 2006 section 58 (A company's name)|Companies Act 2006 section 59 (A company's name)	Bristol Airport Plc v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744 (Administration; Liens; Security)|Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34 (Piercing the corporate veil; Limited liability)|McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)	Companies House Form IC01: Us this form to give notice of the intention to carry on business as an investment company.|Companies House Form RR02: This form is for public companies to re-register as a private limited company.|Companies House Form MR06: Use this form to register a statement of a company acting as a trustee after a charge created on or after 6 April 2013 has been registered.
