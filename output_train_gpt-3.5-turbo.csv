Q6,"A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent...","from the creditors. This committee was made up of a few select individuals who were seen as key stakeholders in the debt restructuring process. The formation of this committee had caused some controversy among other creditors who felt left out of the decision-making process. As time went on, it became clear that the creditor committee was exerting a significant amount of influence over the restructuring negotiations. They were able to push through their own agenda and had a considerable say in the terms of the agreement being reached. This raised concerns among other creditors who felt that their interests were not being adequately represented. Some of them even considered taking legal action to challenge the legitimacy of the creditor committee. In the end, the situation highlighted the importance of transparency and fairness in the debt restructuring process. All creditors have a right to be involved in the decision-making process and their voices should be heard and considered. Ultimately, it's important for all parties involved to work together towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",1.8250188827514648,1
