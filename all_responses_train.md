## Question 1

*Text of Q1*: I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.

I'm not a lawyer, but I can offer you some general guidance on this matter. It's important to consult with a legal professional to get accurate advice specific to your situation. Firstly, keep a record of all the documentation and correspondence related to your departure from the company, including the stock transfer form and any communication about your removal from the business. This will be essential if any disputes arise. It is strange that you were never officially removed from the business despite signing the stock transfer form. It's crucial to determine whether this was a genuine oversight or if there might be some kind of fraudulent activity at play. Again, consulting with a lawyer will help you understand your legal rights and options in this situation. In the meantime, it's a good idea to send the keys back to the other director via recorded delivery, as you mentioned. This will serve as evidence that you have returned the keys and will prevent any accusations of theft or unauthorized access. Lastly, you should also inform any relevant parties, such as the company's employees, clients, or other stakeholders, about your departure and the current situation. This will help ensure transparency and prevent any potential confusion or further issues. Remember, seeking legal advice is crucial to ensure you are fully informed about your rights and how to best protect yourself in this situation.

I'm an AI language model, not a lawyer, so I can't provide legal advice, but here are some general things you might consider: 1. Consult a lawyer: This is a fairly serious situation that may have both legal and financial implications. You should consult with a legal professional who specializes in business law before taking any action. 2. Stock Transfer Form: A stock transfer form does not necessarily absolve you of all responsibility or permissions related to a company. It typically transfers ownership of the company's shares. You should review that document and any other documents you signed when you left the company to ensure you understand their terms. 3. Check Your Status: Verify whether or not you were officially removed from the company. You can usually do this by checking the company's filings with your country's business registration agency. For example, in the UK, you'd check with Companies House. 4. Document Your Steps: Put everything related to this situation in writing. Send any communication through e-mail or another medium that can be tracked and saved. This will provide a record of your actions should you need one. 5. Professional Help: You may want to consider hiring a professional who specializes in the dissolution of businesses. This can be a complicated process often requiring the sale of company assets and the distribution of the resulting funds to creditors and shareholders. Remember that this general advice and that the specifics of your situation may require a different action. A legal professional would be best equipped to guide you in this situation.

I am not a lawyer, but I can provide some general guidance based on the information you have provided. Firstly, it is important to consult with a corporate insolvency lawyer who can provide you with specific legal advice tailored to your situation. Regarding the stock transfer form you signed, it is possible that it may have removed your ownership interest in the business, but it may not have necessarily removed your directorship or other responsibilities and obligations as a director. Directors have legal duties and obligations to the company, even if they are no longer shareholders. If you have concerns about your status as a director and the actions taken by the other director, it may be appropriate to seek legal advice about these matters. A lawyer can review the specific details and documentation related to your situation to determine the best course of action. Additionally, it is important to ensure that you do not engage in any activities that might be seen as unauthorized or potentially harmful to the company. Returning the keys and any company property is a reasonable step to take to avoid any potential accusations. Overall, I would highly recommend consulting with a corporate insolvency lawyer who can guide you through the specific legal requirements and implications of your situation. They can provide you with the necessary advice and assistance to protect your interests and comply with your legal obligations.

### insolvency_bot_with_gpt-4 response to Q1 (score: 3.0)

I'm sorry to hear about your predicament. It's important to note that simply signing a stock transfer form does not automatically cancel your legal obligations or responsibilities as a director or relieve you of the duties that you owe to the company. The stock transfer form is the legal document used to transfer shares from one party to another, but it does not relate to your status as a director. To resign as a director, you would need to have submitted a TM01 form to Companies House. Until Companies House receives this form, you remain a director from the perspective of the law, and you retain all of the rights and responsibilities that come with this role. Therefore, you may still be legally obligated to take steps to deal with the company's debts and wind down the business. However, it's important that you take action carefully to ensure you don't run afoul of the Insolvency Act 1986 or the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, which impose strict rules on directors of insolvent companies. If you were listed as a co-director and didn't officially resign via the TM01 form, it's entirely possible that the responsibilities now fall to you. This does not, however, necessarily imply that you are personally responsible for the company's debts unless, for example, you've guaranteed them. I would advise you to consult with a solicitor and an insolvency practitioner as soon as possible. A solicitor can help you to understand your legal obligations and protect your interests, while an insolvency practitioner can help to manage the process of dealing with the company's debts and winding down its business. Please remember that this advice is intended to be general in nature, and specific facts or circumstances could change the appropriate course of action. As such, it's essential to seek legal advice that's tailored to your situation.

## Question 2

*Text of Q2*: Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. It's understandable that you are feeling angry and stressed. While I cannot provide legal advice, I can suggest some general steps you can take: 1. Document everything: Keep a record of all communication between your partner and X. This includes text messages, emails, and any promises made regarding payment. 2. Research your rights: Look into employment laws and subcontractor obligations in your country. This will help you understand your legal position and options. 3. Seek professional advice: Contact a solicitor or legal professional who specializes in employment or contract law. They will be able to advise you on the specific legal steps you can take to recover the unpaid wages. 4. Contact X and Y: If possible, keep trying to communicate with X and Y and request payment. Make sure to document all attempts at contact. 5. Report to the relevant authorities: If all else fails, you may need to report the situation to the appropriate government agency or labor department. They can provide guidance on how to file a formal complaint or take legal action. 6. Consider contacting the house builder: While it's uncertain if the house builder will intervene, you can try reaching out to them to inform them about the subcontractor's behavior. They might be interested in the actions of their subcontractors and could potentially put pressure on X and Y to resolve the issue. Remember, it's important to consult with a legal professional to understand your rights and options in your specific situation. They will be able to provide you with the most accurate advice based on the laws in your country.

I'm an AI and not a legal expert, but here are a few general steps that you might consider: 1. Document everything: Make sure you have all your facts straight and any proof that may be relevant, including any correspondence with X and Y, employment contracts, invoices for work performed etc. 2. Contact a Solicitor: Reach out to a solicitor who specializes in employment law. They can guide you through the legal process, explain your rights and the steps you can take. 3. Small Claims Court: Depending on the amount, and if solicitors' assistance is not affordable, you might consider applying to a small claims court. It's designed to be simple and inexpensive, enabling you to resolve disputes without the need for a lawyer. 4. Communicate with Y and the big house builder: It might help to let Y and the house builder know about the situation. You can explain the situation to them and ask if they can assist in any way. 5. Seek support: Don't forget to reach out for support – NGOs, charitable organisations or your local council may have resources available to support families in need. Remember to consult with a legal expert before taking any action- they can give you advice specifically tailored to your situation.

I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you and your partner are facing. Given the complex nature of your case and the specific details involved, it is advisable to consult with a solicitor or lawyer who specializes in corporate insolvency law. They will be able to provide you with tailored advice based on your circumstances. In general, if your partner has not been paid the amount owed to him by subcontractor X, he may have legal recourse to recover the unpaid wages. Possible avenues to explore include: 1. Direct Communication: Your partner should continue trying to contact X and document any communication attempts made. It may also be worth contacting subcontractor Y and informing them of the situation, as they may have liability for unpaid wages owed by X. 2. Statutory Demands: Your partner could consider issuing a statutory demand to X, which is a formal demand for payment of a debt. If X fails to respond or fails to pay within the prescribed time period (21 days), this could be grounds to apply for bankruptcy or petition for winding-up against the company. 3. Small Claims Court: If the amount owed is within the limit set for

I'm really sorry to hear about the difficulties your family is currently experiencing. These are very tough circumstances and I can understand why you would be desperate for answers and solutions. In this scenario the company your partner was working for (X) would normally be responsible for paying your partner's wage. It appears X is experiencing some type of financial issue which has resulted in the non-payment of the wages. Your first step can be, if you haven't done so already, to put your concerns in writing to X, and keeping a copy of the communication. If X is unable to pay, you can consider making an application to wind up the company. This is a serious step and can lead to liquidation of the company. Next, you might have an argument for 'piercing the corporate veil', which is a legal principle in the UK that allows the courts to look beyond the company to the individuals controlling it in instances of fraud or improper conduct. This is however a high bar. For instance, in the case of Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34, it was held that the veil could be pierced in case of evasion of liabilities. However, each case is highly dependent on facts and circumstances, so advice needs to be taken. Also, check if your partner's contract was strictly with X or whether Y had any obligations under it. This could potentially give you another entity to seek recovery from. Bear in mind, further action may be required under the Insolvency Act 1986 if X is actually insolvent (cannot pay its debts as they fall due). If that is the case, creditors (like your partner) can potentially make an application to have the company wound up. As for the larger house builder, it could be worth contacting them to make them aware of the situation. However, it's unlikely they would have legal responsibility for your partner's wages unless there's some sort of direct contract in place with them. You could contact ACAS for advice. They provide free and impartial information and advice to employers and employees on all aspects of workplace relations and employment law. StepChange Debt Charity could also provide free and comprehensive debt advice. Please consult with a legal professional about your specific case. The above is general information based on the cases and laws you provided, and should not be used as legal advice. Do you want me to look at the Companies Forms for DS01, MT03, and RT01?

## Question 3

*Text of Q3*: Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?

I'm sorry to hear about your difficult situation. It is important to note that I can provide general legal information and guidance, but I am not able to provide specific legal advice. To address your concerns, you may want to consider consulting with a specialist insolvency lawyer who can provide you with tailored advice based on the specific details of your case. In general, when a company is in liquidation, the liquidators have a duty to collect and distribute the assets of the company to its creditors. If Company B is liable for the intercompany loan, it may be required to repay that loan as part of the liquidation process. This could potentially add to the financial burdens of Company B. However, it is important to review the specific terms of the loan agreement and the circumstances surrounding the intercompany loan to determine the extent of Company B's liability. Additionally, it may be possible to negotiate with the liquidators or explore alternative options to mitigate the impact on Company B, such as restructuring or negotiating payment plans. Consulting with an insolvency lawyer will help you understand your rights and options, and they can provide guidance on strategies to protect your interests and minimize the potential losses. They can also assist with negotiations and potential legal proceedings, such as challenging the liquidation or seeking alternative resolutions. Remember, every case is unique, and it's crucial to seek professional advice tailored to your specific situation. An insolvency lawyer will be best equipped to guide you through this difficult time and help you make informed decisions. Please note that I am an AI language model and cannot provide specific legal advice or representation. It is always recommended to consult with a qualified lawyer for your legal needs.

### insolvency_bot_with_gpt-4 response to Q3 (score: 9.5)

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. It's clear you're facing a lot of stress and pressure right now. However, remember I'm here to help you navigate through this and assist you to find the best possible solution. First and foremost, you might want to consider obtaining independent legal advice about your position, especially if you feel that the liquidator might not be acting in your best interests. Next, in regards to the RLS loan and the intercompany loan, it's important to understand the terms of these loans and guarantees. Loan agreements might have stipulations on repayments, especially in the event of insolvency, and guarantees can also differ. Remember that as a director, you have some statutory duties under the Companies Act 2006. These duties include promoting success for the benefit of members and ensuring business decisions are made in good faith. If a company is insolvent, or nearing insolvency, duties shift from shareholders to creditors. In addition, Liquidators have specific duties under the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, including to realize company assets and distribute them to creditors. Misfeasance proceedings can be brought by liquidators if they believe funds have been misappropriated, but they should act reasonably. I'd suggest you ask the liquidator for full details of any claims they are making against you or Company B. It would be useful to see detailed breakdown of their proposed actions and the legal grounds they are basing them on. You should also consider speaking to an insolvency practitioner or specialist solicitor who can advise you on whether placing Company B into administration is the best course of action for you at this time. They can also help review the liquidator's valuations and strategy for Company B. Directors can potentially face disqualification proceedings under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 if they have acted improperly, negligently or dishonestly but this requires a court order and evidence of such conduct. It does not sound like this is the case here. This is a complex situation, and certainly one where professional expert advice is needed. I would recommend consulting with a solicitor or an insolvency practitioner who can assist you to navigate through this difficult time and advice you on the possible legal remedies. Please remember not to lose hope. There are solutions and strategies which can be explored in situations like this.

I am not a legal expert, but I can provide some general information on this topic. In many jurisdictions, limited liability protection is a fundamental principle, meaning that the debts of a limited liability company (LTD) generally remain within the company itself and do not directly extend to its directors or shareholders. However, there are situations when the concept of "piercing the corporate veil" may come into play. This occurs when a court determines that the limited liability protection should be disregarded, typically in cases where there is evidence of fraudulent activity or an abuse of the company structure to avoid personal obligations. If the court decides to pierce the corporate veil, it may hold the director personally liable for the debts. Whether company assets can be seized to pay a personal debt would depend on various factors, including the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of the debt. In some cases, if it can be proven that funds or assets were improperly transferred from the individual to the company to avoid personal obligations, they may be subject to clawback by the debtor to satisfy the debt. It is crucial to consult with a legal professional who specializes in corporate law or insolvency to obtain accurate advice based on your specific situation and applicable laws in your jurisdiction.

No, typically personal debts of a director cannot be paid by seizing the assets of a limited company. A limited company is considered a separate legal entity from its directors and shareholders. This separation protects the company’s assets from being used to satisfy the director’s personal liabilities and vice versa. However, if the director has given personal guarantees for business loans or has been found guilty of wrongful or fraudulent trading, then they could be held personally liable for debts of the company. It is highly recommended to seek legal and financial advice in such situation.

In general, the principle of limited liability means that company debts are separate from the personal liabilities of its directors and shareholders. This means that if a company incurs debts, the company itself is responsible for paying them, and the personal assets of the directors or shareholders cannot be seized to satisfy the company's debts. However, there are exceptions to this general principle, and circumstances where personal assets of directors can be at risk. It's important to consider the specific details of the situation and seek legal advice for accurate guidance. Here are a few scenarios where personal assets of a director may be at risk: 1. Personal guarantee: If a director has given a personal guarantee for a company debt, they can be personally liable for that debt. In such cases, the

As a general rule, under the principle of limited liability as established by the case of Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22, directors or shareholders of a limited company are not personally responsible for the company's debts, and their liability is limited to their investment in the shares of the company. This principle works both ways, meaning that company assets cannot be seized to pay the director's personal debts. However, there are exceptions to this rule in certain circumstances. If the director has personally guaranteed the company's debts, then those personal assets can be at risk if the company goes into insolvency. Furthermore, in extreme cases where the corporate veil can be pierced because the court finds that the company is a sham or a facade, the directors or shareholders may be held personally liable for the company's debts. But these are rare and require clear evidence of wrongdoing or misuse of the company structure for fraudulent or improper purposes, as established by cases like Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34 and Gilford Motor Co. Ltd v Horne [1933] Ch. 935. If a director is found to have carried on trading when the company is insolvent and there is no realistic prospect of paying its debts (wrongful trading), then they can be made personally liable for the company's additional debts incurred from that point, under section 214 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Similarly, under section 15 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, a director can be made personally liable for a company's debts if they continue to act as a director while disqualified or bankrupt. From the perspective of a personal creditor of a director, they can only enforce their debt against the personal assets of that director, and not the assets of the director's companies. Any attempt to seize company assets would likely be met with strong resistance and could lead to legal proceedings for 'trespass to goods' or 'conversion'. In conclusion, while there are circumstances in which a director or shareholder can be personally liable for a company's debts, these scenarios do not extend to company assets being available to satisfy a director's personal liabilities. It is always advisable to seek legal advice in these situations to fully understand your rights and obligations.

## Question 5

*Text of Q5*: I posted a thread s few weeks back about "closing my ltd company and who to pay" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should "find the money from somewhere". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?

I'm not a legal expert, but I can offer some general information that might be helpful. It's important to consult with a professional such as a lawyer or an insolvency practitioner to get specific advice tailored to your situation. Firstly, it's essential to understand the terms and conditions of the contract you entered into with Utility Bidder. If you believe you have not breached the contract, you may want to review the agreement carefully and gather any evidence or documentation supporting your position. Regarding dissolving your limited company, having an outstanding debt may indeed complicate the dissolution process. In some cases, it may be necessary to clear all outstanding debts before dissolving the company. Speaking with an insolvency practitioner or a lawyer who specializes in company dissolution can provide more clarity in this matter. Considering the financial circumstances of your company, it may be wise to explore the option of a payment plan with the debt collection agency. Negotiating a reasonable repayment schedule may help avoid potential legal action. However, it's important to assess the legitimacy of the debt and seek professional advice before committing to any payment plan or making payments. Lastly, it's worth noting that debt collection agencies often use various tactics to recover the debt. It's important to maintain clear communication with the agency, document any interactions, and stay focused on seeking professional advice to understand your rights and obligations. Remember, this is only general information, and seeking professional advice should be your top priority to navigate this situation effectively.

I'm an AI developed by OpenAI and although I cannot provide specific legal advice, I can give you some general pointers. Firstly, if your company is not able to pay its debt, it might need to go into insolvency. Before you take any actions, it would be wise to seek advice from an accountant, a solicitor, or a licensed insolvency practitioner. It's important to remember that there's a legal difference between an individual and a company. If the company owes the money, that's not necessarily a debt of yours personally (unless a personal guarantee was provided). In theory, the company's debts die with the company once dissolved. However, please be aware that compulsory striking-off isn’t the same as voluntary liquidation, and may be more complicated if the company has debts. There may also be serious repercussions if you do not inform all interested parties (the creditors in this case) about the closure. Remember to companies house WebFiling service to continually check the status of your company. If some objections arise the strike off will be suspended and you may have to deal with it accordingly. Make sure to collect and distribute all the company's assets - if indeed anything remains - among the creditors and agree upon a plan of action, if possible. If no agreement can be found, then you might need to voluntarily liquidate the company, apply for voluntary dissolution or let the company be struck off. Please consider seeking professional advice for your specific situation. The above information should not be relied upon as legal advice and is intended as general guidance only.

I am not a lawyer, but I can try to offer some general guidance based on the information you've provided. Firstly, it's important to note that as a limited company, your personal liability is generally limited to the company's debts and obligations. However, there are situations where directors can be personally liable for certain debts, such as if they have given personal guarantees for company loans or if there has been wrongful trading or fraudulent activity. Regarding the debt collection agency's claim, it's advisable to seek legal advice to assess the validity of the claim and the enforceability of the contract. If you believe that you have not breached the contract or that the terms are unfair or unreasonable, you may have grounds to dispute the debt and defend against any legal action. In terms of dissolving your company, it is generally possible to apply for voluntary strike-off or voluntary liquidation if the company is solvent and has no outstanding debts or liabilities. However, if there are outstanding debts, it may be more appropriate to consider other options such as a formal insolvency process like administration or liquidation. Consulting with an insolvency practitioner would be beneficial in determining the best course of action based on your specific circumstances. It's also worth noting that the process of winding up a company does not automatically extinguish or invalidate existing contracts, and any outstanding debts or obligations may still need to be addressed. Lastly, I would recommend seeking legal advice from a qualified professional who specializes in corporate insolvency to ensure you receive the most accurate and tailored advice for your situation. They will be able to assess your specific circumstances and provide guidance on the best course of action.

From the information provided, it seems like the debt collection agency is trying to claim that your company breached its contract with Utility Bidder by not completing the full 3-year term. However, the situation appears to be more complicated than that. Firstly, if your company has ceased trading and has no assets or income, it may be insolvent under the terms of the Insolvency Act 1986 section 123, as it is unable to pay its debts. Secondly, while it is true that under the laws stated in Insolvency Act 1986 section 124, companies with outstanding debts cannot be dissolved, it's also true that this generally refers to debts that are undisputed and acknowledged by the company. If there is a dispute about the debt or its amount, the debt collection agency might fail to prevent the dissolution. Moreover, even if your company owes this debt, the agency would have to go to court and get a judgment against your company before Companies House would stop the dissolution process, which takes time and money. In case of insolvency, the law (Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) and Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383) mandates assessing a company's cash-flow and balance-sheet to determine its financial condition. Consequently, you cannot be personally liable for the company's debt unless there is proof of wrongful trading or fraud (Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986). The assets you mentioned (equipment, knives/bowls etc) are yours personally and not assets of the company (unless you specifically transferred them to the company) and thus cannot be claimed to pay off company's debts. Finally, in line with BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch), directors have a fiduciary duty to safeguard the interests of creditors when the company nears insolvency. Therefore, taking advice from an insolvency practitioner could be a prudent step, even if you don't eventually appoint one. Please consult professional legal counsel to discuss these matters further and determine the best course of action as this is just preliminary advice.

I am not a lawyer, but I can offer some general information on the topic. The ability to remove or add members to a creditor committee would likely depend on the specific laws and regulations governing the committee's formation and operation. It is recommended to consult with a legal professional or review any relevant agreements or bylaws to determine the procedures and requirements for making changes to the committee. In general, to remove existing members and replace them with others, you may need to follow the established procedures outlined in the committee's governing documents. This may involve holding a meeting and obtaining the necessary votes or consents from the creditors to approve the removal and replacement of members. To add new members, you will also need to review the governing documents to determine if there are any provisions allowing for such additions. If there are no specific provisions, you may need to consult with legal counsel to explore alternatives and ensure any actions taken comply with applicable laws and regulations. It's important to note that these steps may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances surrounding the creditor committee.

As an AI language model, I can provide general advice on this matter, but please consult a professional attorney in your jurisdiction for legal assistance. Forming a creditor's committee under bankruptcy proceedings typically follows certain rules and regulations as defined by jurisdictions' bankruptcy laws. Usually, the court or United States Trustee (U.S) appoints the committee members. 1. Removing Existing Members/Adding New Members: If the creditor committee is not acting in the best interest of the creditors, it's probably possible to make changes to its composition. However, this process isn't straightforward and can vary depending on the bankruptcy laws of the jurisdiction. Generally, this involves presenting a case to the court or U.S. Trustee and providing evidence showing how the committee members are not acting in the creditors' best interests. Some jurisdictions may require a majority vote by the creditors to make changes to the committee. 2. Election of a New Committee: Alternatively, you might consider forming a new committee. Depending upon the jurisdiction, this might require a vote among creditors or permission from the bankruptcy court. In both scenarios, it's crucial to document all instances of negligent or unscrupulous behaviors to establish a solid case against the creditor committee. In any case, the best course of action is to consult with a bankruptcy attorney or legal expert who can provide advice based on your specific circumstances and local laws.

If you are dissatisfied with the actions and decisions of the creditor committee and believe that changes need to be made, there are certain steps you can take to address your concerns. 1. Removing existing members and replacing them with others: a. Review the relevant governing documents, such as the company's articles of association or the terms of reference for the creditor committee. These documents may outline the process for removing and replacing committee members. b. Check if there are any specific grounds or procedures for removal outlined in the governing documents. In the absence of such provisions, general company law principles and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 may apply. c. Hold a meeting of the creditors and propose the removal of specific committee members. This can be done by calling a creditors' meeting and obtaining the necessary voting majority to approve the removal. d. Ensure that the proposed replacements meet any eligibility criteria set out in the governing documents and obtain their consent to serve as committee members. e. Follow any notification or filing requirements set by Companies House or other relevant authorities when making changes to the committee membership. 2. Adding new members: a. Again, review the governing documents to determine if there are any provisions for adding new committee members. b. If permitted, propose the addition of new members at a creditors' meeting and seek approval from the other creditors. c. Ensure that the proposed new members meet any eligibility criteria set out in the governing documents and obtain their consent to serve on the committee. d. Comply with any notification or filing requirements when adding new members. 3. Seek legal advice: It is advisable to consult with a corporate insolvency lawyer who can review the specific circumstances and governing documents of your case. They can provide tailored advice and guidance on the best course of action, ensuring compliance with relevant statutes and legal obligations. Remember, the specific process for removing and adding members to a creditor committee may vary depending on the governing documents and the particular circumstances of the case. Seeking legal advice will help you navigate the process effectively.

The procedure for removing or adding members to a creditors' committee are provided in The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016. Rule 17.8 lays out the procedure for replacing a member of a committee if they cease to be a member. It provides that a person may be appointed to fill a vacancy if: a. The office-holder and a majority of the remaining creditor members agree; and b. The total number of creditor members does not fall below three. To proceed with the addition of new members, the agreement of the office-holder and a majority of the existing committee members is again required. However, the total number of creditor members may not exceed five unless the court directs otherwise. Keep in mind that the entirety of the committee can also be dissolved if the members feel it's not acting in their best interests. Rule 17.27 sets out that a creditors' committee may be dissolved if either the office holder obtains a court order or if, after notifying the office holder, more than 50% in value of the company's creditors direct it. If the committee doesn't perform satisfactorily, you could always consider lodging a complaint to the insolvency practitioner's authorizing body. As per the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, insolvency practitioners must adhere to set standards--failure to do so could lead to a misconduct investigation. Finally, it may be worth considering whether you need to form a new committee. Less formal gatherings of creditors may suffice if the key concern is to ensure consultation between the office holder and the creditors. This could be a less formal "consultation group" or "informal committee", which has no statutory recognition or protection, but which can often serve useful purposes. Remember this is a complex matter and it is always advisable to consult your legal advisor or solicitor.

## Question 7

*Text of Q7*: We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.

I am not a legal expert, but I can provide some general information that may be helpful to you. In this situation, if the company cannot sustain its operations due to a lack of income and one of the shareholders/directors wishes to leave, it may be necessary to consider the option of liquidation. Liquidation is a legal process where a company's assets are sold off to pay its debts, and the company is eventually dissolved. In your case, if the business cannot continue without the other shareholder/director and you are unable to meet your contractual obligations, liquidation might be the appropriate action to take. It would be advisable to consult with a legal professional or insolvency practitioner who specializes in company liquidations. They will be able to provide you with accurate advice based on your specific circumstances and the applicable laws in your jurisdiction.

### gpt-4 response to Q7 (score: 3.5)

In the case of company insolvency or dissolution, all contractual obligations should ideally be paid off. If the telecoms contract cannot be paid off, then you could potentially face legal consequences such as a lawsuit from the telecoms company, though how they choose to enforce the contract is a matter of their discretion assuming the contract is in the company name and not personally guaranteed by the directors. It's possible you could go through an informal dissolution if this is your only outstanding liability, but bear in mind that the telecom company might raise an objection during the wind-up notice period. If it seems likely that the telecoms company will pursue the debt, it may be in your best interest to use a liquidator. They will be able to handle the issue with more finesse and potentially negotiate a settlement with the telecom company. Before you make any decisions, it would be a good idea to consult with a solicitor or business advisor so you can fully understand all potential consequences. This information is provided as a guideline and should not be used as legal advice. Remember, closing a company with outstanding contracts can affect your credit history and future borrowing ability, so ensure to take considered steps.

Based on the information provided, it seems like the company is currently facing financial difficulties and may not be able to continue its operations in the long term. In this situation, you may consider the following options: 1. Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL): If both shareholders/directors agree to wind up the company voluntarily, you can consider an MVL. This is a formal process where a liquidator is appointed to wind up the affairs of the company, sell its assets, and distribute the proceeds to the shareholders. 2. Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL): If the company is unable to pay its debts and you want to wind up the company voluntarily, you can consider a CVL. This process involves appointing a liquidator who will realize the company's assets, settle its debts to the extent possible, and distribute any remaining funds to the creditors. 3. Dissolution: If the company has no debts and no assets, you may also consider applying for voluntary dissolution. This is a simpler process and does not involve appointing a liquidator. However, it is important to ensure that all creditors have been paid, as dissolving the company with outstanding debts can result in personal liability for the directors. It is advisable to consult with a solicitor or a licensed insolvency practitioner to discuss the specific circumstances of your company and determine the most appropriate course of action. They can guide you through the process, ensure compliance with legal requirements, and provide advice on the termination of the telecoms contract.

### insolvency_bot_with_gpt-4 response to Q7 (score: 9.5)

Based on the principles set out in the cases and statutes you've mentioned, in your situation the best course of action may depend on a few key factors. It is worth noting that if your company is technically solvent right now (as it appears you have suggested), but is facing a certain future liability it is likely to be unable to meet (the telecoms contract), the position might be somewhat complicated. Under the ruling in 'BNY Corporate Trustee Services vs Eurosail' [2013], the ability of your company to meet its liabilities, both prospective and contingent, is to be determined on the balance of probabilities with the burden of proof on the party asserting "balance-sheet insolvency". This means that winding up a company because of a future liability must take into account all circumstances, including the probability of that liability coming into effect. Further in the 'BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA' [2016] case, the judge decided that where a company had on its balance sheet an estimated provision in respect of a long-term liability, directors are not required to take account of creditors' interests when running a business and therefore a company would not necessarily be regarded as insolvent. In terms of the telecoms contract, the decision in 'Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services' [2011] could be relevant. This case discussed the concept of the anti-deprivation principle, which is a principle of insolvency law which states that an agreement (for example, a contract) cannot remove assets from a company on its insolvency to the detriment of the general body of creditors. On a practical note, if the telecoms company were to make a claim against you after the company is dissolved for not fulfilling the contract, it would be as an unsecured creditor. If there are no assets left in the company, there is not much they can do to enforce the debt. It sounds like you may wish to consider dissolving (striking off) the company if it is no longer needed. This is different from liquidation and generally involves a simpler process. Companies House Form DS01 is used for applying for the company to be struck off the register and dissolved. Dissolving the company can prevent new debts or obligations from arising. Remember, you should always seek professional advice for your specific situation. The opinion provided above is based on general legal principles and should not be taken as definitive legal advice. If in doubt, contact a professional advisor or solicitor to discuss your situation in more detail.

## Question 9

*Text of Q9*: Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA

That being said, if you're considering closing or selling the business, here are a few steps you may want to consider: 1. Assess your financial situation: Take a close look at your financial records to get a clear understanding of your debts, assets, and ongoing expenses. This will help you determine how much you owe and what options are available to you. 2. Consider your options: Discuss with your accountant the possible options for the future of your business. This could include selling the business, restructuring the company, or closing it down entirely. They can help you understand the implications of each option and how it would impact your finances and personal liabilities. 3. Communicate with your creditors: If you're considering closing the business, it's important to communicate with your creditors, including the bank and any outstanding suppliers. Explain your situation and explore possible payment plans or arrangements, keeping them informed of your progress. 4. Liquidate assets: If you decide to close the business, you may need to sell off any remaining assets to help pay off any outstanding debts. This could include the lease cars or any other equipment the business owns. 5. Seek professional advice: If you're unsure about any legal or financial aspects of the process, it's advisable to consult a lawyer or insolvency practitioner who can guide you through the necessary steps and help ensure you're complying with all legal requirements. Remember, these steps are general suggestions and may not apply to your specific circumstances. Your accountant will be the best resource to provide you with tailored advice based on your situation.

I'm an AI and while I can't give direct financial advice, I can suggest you various potential options outlined in general advice given to businesses in this circumstance. 1. Business Sale: If you have assets, goodwill, or a client base, you may want to consider selling your business. This process would involve finding a buyer who is interested in taking over the operations. You can approach business brokers or online marketplaces for business sales. 2. Business Rescaling: As another option, you may consider slimming down your operations to be leaner and more cost-effective. This might entail eliminating unprofitable lines of service or focusing on more profitable B2B customers. 3. Creditors Voluntary Liquidation (CVL): If debt repayment is unmanageable and the business is insolvent (i.e., it can't pay its debts as they become due), you might consider a CVL. This includes appointing an insolvency practitioner to liquidate your company's assets to repay creditors. 4. Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA): If your company is insolvent but could potentially be viable again, you might consider a CVA. This would involve negotiating with your creditors to allow for reduced monthly payments over a set period. 5. Administration: If your company is insolvent, you might consider entering into administration. An insolvency practitioner would be appointed to manage your company, with the priority being to pay the debt owed to creditors. 6. Dissolving or "Striking off" the Company: You may also consider dissolving the company, but keep in mind that you must follow strict guidelines as outlined by HMRC. Please consider seeking advice from a professional advisor, or contacting the Business Debtline, or a licensed insolvency practitioner, before taking any significant steps. Nothing in this message should be considered professional advice. Always consult a qualified professional about your specific circumstances.

I am not a lawyer, but I can provide some general guidance on the options you may consider in your situation. It is always recommended to consult with a qualified insolvency professional or solicitor for specific legal advice tailored to your circumstances. 1. Assess the viability of the business: Before making any decisions, it is important to carefully evaluate the financial position and future prospects of the company. Consider factors such as cash flow, profitability, market conditions, and customer demand. If the business is no longer sustainable, it may be necessary to explore options for closure or sale. 2. Inform your accountant: Schedule a meeting with your accountant to discuss the financial situation of the company and potential options available. They will be able to provide advice specific to your business and help you navigate the necessary steps. 3. Company closure: a. Voluntary liquidation: You may consider voluntary liquidation, where the company's assets are realized and distributed to creditors in accordance with insolvency laws. This process allows for an orderly wind-up of the business. b. Members' voluntary liquidation: If the company is solvent, you may choose to initiate a members' voluntary liquidation, where the company's assets are liquidated and distributed to shareholders. c. Strike off the register: Another option is to apply for the company to be struck off the register at Companies House. This is

Based on the information you've provided, it seems that voluntary liquidation might be the most suitable course of action for your business. This process will enable you to close down your company in an orderly fashion, paying off creditors as much as possible. However, it is important to note that once you are of the opinion that your company may not be able to pay its debts, your legal responsibilities shift from the company's shareholders to its creditors. From this moment it is important that you do not incur further credit otherwise you may face personal liability. As your company has outstanding debt, the liquidation process will likely be a 'Creditors Voluntary Liquidation' (CVL). This involves appointing an Insolvency Practitioner to liquidate the company's assets, settle any legal disputes and distribute the proceeds to the creditors. Any surplus funds can then be distributed among the shareholders. You mentioned that your Overdraft (OD) with your bank has a directors' guarantee, please be aware this means that if the company cannot pay this debt, the bank can pursue you personally for the repayment. This liability will not be eliminated by the company going into liquidation. As for the leased cars, if there's no personal guarantee, the leasing company will become a creditor in the liquidation and will typically repossess the cars. Finally, it is important that you consult with your accountant and a licensed Insolvency Practitioner. They can guide you through the process and help you understand what you need to do as a director. Most insolvency practitioners offer the initial consultation for free. Please also be aware that wrt BBL Natwest, according to the government rules, directors are not personally liable for the repayments of Bounce Back Loans if the business can't pay. This is general advice and the actual course of action may vary depending on the detailed circumstances of your business. Please, always take legal advice.

## Question 10

*Text of Q10*: Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks

I'm not a financial advisor, but I can offer some general guidance. It's important to seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a qualified accountant who can assess your specific situation and provide guidance tailored to your needs. They can help determine the best course of action, such as exploring alternatives to bankruptcy or guiding you through the bankruptcy process if it becomes necessary. In terms of independent advice, you can consider reaching out to organizations like Citizens Advice or Business Debtline. These organizations can provide free and impartial advice on debt-related issues, including bankruptcy, and may be able to guide you through the options available to you. They can also help you understand the potential consequences of bankruptcy on your future prospects. Additionally, researching and reaching out to insolvency practitioners for a consultation can be helpful. They can provide expert guidance and help you understand the options available to you, as well as any potential alternatives to bankruptcy. Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so it's important to consult with professionals who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

I'm sorry to hear about your financial troubles. It's evident that this situation is causing you a great deal of anxiety and stress. At this point, it can be useful to consider all available options and try to make the best possible decisions. Here are some steps you could consider: 1. **Hire a Financial Counselor or an Insolvency Practitioner**: They can guide you through this process and provide detailed advice based on your specific condition. 2. **Consult a Solicitor**: If your former accountants have been negligent in their duties, it may be possible to sue them for professional negligence - you would need to talk to a solicitor for a full assessment of this potential option. 3. **Talk to your Creditors**: This includes the tax authority and anyone else your business owes money to. They might be able to work out a payment plan or voluntary agreement that allows you to gradually pay back your debt and avoid bankruptcy. 4. **Understand your Liability**: As a director of a limited company, you're not personally liable for the firm's debts unless you've personally guaranteed them or have taken illegal dividends like in your case. It's essential to understand this while considering your options. 5. **Consider an Individual Voluntary Agreement (IVA)**: This formal agreement lets you pay off your debts in an affordable way and avoid personal bankruptcy. An insolvency practitioner can help you with the process. 6. **Set Up a Payment Plan**: HMRC has provisions for 'Time to Pay Arrangements', allowing businesses in financial distress to pay their tax liabilities in installments over a period. 7. **Liquidating the Company**: If there is no way out, and the company is insolvent, you might need to consider liquidating your company to pay off as much of the debts as possible. Remember, taking illegal dividends does have legal implications, and it can make you personally liable for the company's debts. It's recommended to get independent financial and legal advice straight away. This situation may weigh you down, but remember you're not alone. Use the many resources available online and offline to help you navigate this challenging period.

I'm really sorry to hear about the situation you're in. Although it's difficult, it's crucial that you're proactive in dealing with this. First of all, it's important for you to understand that if you have taken an overdrawn director's loan or so-called 'illegal dividends,' then that creates a debt owed by you to the company, which may become due for repayment. Your personal liability depends on the way these dividends were declared and whether the company was insolvent at the time they were declared, and following declarations. One saving grace might be if the dividends were declared based on inaccurate accounts provided by the company's accountants. Case law such as BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) looked at whether dividends can be deemed as a transaction at undervalue or an unlawful distribution. If it can be proved that the dividends were declared based on accounts that showed a profit when there was, in fact, none; you might be able to take action against the accountants, but you should seek immediate legal advice on this. It's also important to keep in mind the directors' duties under the Companies Act 2006, section 172. Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, would likely promote the success of the company, and if at any point you realized or should have realized that there's no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvency, you should take every step to minimize potential loss to the company's creditors. Directors' disqualification (as per the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986) is often a consequence of misconduct, especially in insolvency situations. But the disqualification isn't automatic and depends on the conduct of the director. Turning to your personal situation, bankruptcy isn't the only way to deal with personal debt: Debt Relief Orders, Individual Voluntary Arrangements, and informal arrangements are all potential alternatives to bankruptcy, and it may be useful to seek advice from a debt advice agency. Even if bankruptcy does become inevitable, remember it's not the end of everything. Many people recover from bankruptcy and go on to lead successful personal and business lives (Director disqualification doesn't necessarily follow personal bankruptcy). Please note that all the above is only general advice and every case is different, and this is a complex situation that needs specialist advice. You should contact an Insolvency Practitioner or a solicitor specializing in insolvency, ideally one recommended by someone you trust, as soon as you can. They will be able to help you navigate through the situation and provide you with advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

## Question 12

*Text of Q12*: Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?

I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're going through with your business. While I cannot provide personal experiences or opinions, I can offer some general information that may be helpful. When it comes to closing a company, the process can vary depending on the country and its legal system. In the UK, if you want to dissolve a company voluntarily, you can apply to strike it off the register at Companies House. Before doing so, it is usually advisable to inform all creditors, stop trading, and settle any outstanding debts. Regarding the bounce back loan, it's important to carefully review the terms and conditions of the loan agreement you have with HSBC. Ideally, you should discuss your plans to close the company with them and understand how it impacts your loan repayment obligations. If you're unable to repay the loan, it's possible that HSBC may seek to recover the amount owed through other means, such as legal action or by providing your details to debt collection agencies. However, each lender has its own policies and approach, so it's crucial to have a discussion with HSBC to understand their stance on this matter. Additionally, consulting with a legal or financial professional who specializes in company closures would be beneficial. They can provide you with precise guidance based on the specifics of your situation and help you navigate the process effectively. Please keep in mind that the information provided here is general in nature and not a substitute for professional advice.

I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. I understand how painful it must be to watch your business suffer under present circumstances. The steps to dissolving a company varies depending on factors like location, the structure of the company, amount of debts and other various factors. Generally, here are some steps you can consider: 1. Ensure all business-related taxes have been paid, this includes your employees’ payroll taxes. 2. You should file a 'notice of intent' to close down your business with your local and state government. 3. Notify your creditors about your intent to dissolve the business. This is a difficult but necessary step. 4. Liquidate your business assets. This may involve selling physical assets as well as paying off any outstanding debts. 5. Ask your accountant or business lawyer to follow up with final tax returns and necessary paperwork. Concerning your bounce back loan, if your lender agrees to a no affordability scheme, you might still be required to repay the loan if your circumstances change in the future. If the company is struck off without being formally liquidated, you could still personally be liable for the company's debts, though this depends on local law. The most responsible thing you can do is seek out professional guidance to ensure all your t's are crossed and your i's dotted. Reach out to firms that offer free advice initially and see what the best plan of action is for your situation. You're definitely not alone in this, many businesses have had to adjust, pivot, or close due to unfavourable world events. It's heartbreaking but remember that failure isn't the end and you can always start again when you're ready. I hope this helps and best of luck!

I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you are experiencing. That's a tough situation to be in. Given that you owe no debts except for the bounce back loan and the company's capital has been used solely for business purposes, striking off can be an option. Before taking any steps though, be aware of the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, as well as the Companies Act 2006, which govern the process of striking off and possible liabilities as a director. Striking off, as opposed to formal liquidation, is a much simpler and cheaper process, where you apply to Companies House to have your company removed from the register. If all the appropriate steps are taken and there is no objection, the company will usually be struck off around two months after the application is made. A key point to remember here is that striking off does not absolve the company's debts - the creditors can still pursue the directors personally if they wish, which is where the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 is relevant. Mistakes in the striking off process can also lead to a director being disqualified. However, a struck off company that owes a government bounce back loan will extinguish the loan, and it can't be pursued against the directors personally as long as there's been no fraud or misconduct based on cases like BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25. A notice of your intention to strike off the company must be sent to interested parties, including creditors, employees, and directors, among others, as per the Companies Act 2006. The form to do this is Companies House form DS01. Remember that these steps should ideally be taken under the guidance of a legal adviser or an insolvency practitioner to ensure all obligations are met, personal liability is avoided, and everything is done correctly. This is a difficult period, and it's important to seek further advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

## Question 13

*Text of Q13*: Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.

I'm not a lawyer, but I can offer some general advice on partnership matters based on the information you provided. It's important to consult with a legal professional who specializes in business law for your specific situation. 1. Review your partnership agreement: A thorough partnership agreement should outline the terms for expulsion, dissolution, and division of assets. Look for any clauses that cover these scenarios and understand what your rights and obligations are. 2. Seek legal advice: Consult with a business attorney to understand the legal process for expelling a partner and dissolving the partnership. They can guide you through the specific steps you need to take and help you protect your interests. 3. Communicate your concerns: Have an open and honest conversation with your business partner about your concerns, emphasizing the breach of trust and the financial impact. It's essential to have these discussions to see if there is any possibility of resolving the issues without ending the partnership. 4. Explore mediation or negotiation options: If both parties are willing, consider using mediation or negotiation services to reach an agreement on the terms of dissolution. This can help avoid a lengthy and costly legal battle. 5. Calculate balances owed: Work with your attorney and accountant to determine the amount owed to you and the partner in relation to the shortfall. This may involve examining financial records, bank statements, and withdrawal records. Ensure accurate documentation to support your claims. 6. Discuss future of the business: If you decide to continue the business alone, evaluate the financial feasibility and make sure you have a plan to cover any gaps left by the departing partner. Consider the impact of losing their contributions and potential steps to mitigate them. 7. Protect intellectual property and brand: Discuss ownership rights with your attorney, as these aspects may fall under trademark or copyright laws. Determine who has rights to the business name, logo, and other intellectual property. 8. Seek emotional support: Given the stressful nature of the situation, it might be helpful to reach out to friends, family, or a professional counselor to provide emotional support and guidance throughout the process. Remember, it is crucial to consult with a legal professional who can guide you through the specific legalities of your situation. They can provide tailored advice based on your partnership agreement and local laws.

I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this tough time in your partnership. However, I'm an AI language model and I'm not a legal expert, but I can provide some general pointers that might help you. Please make sure to seek proper legal advice for exact solutions. 1. Partnership Agreement: The first place to look when dissolving a partnership is your partnership agreement. This document should provide guidance on how to handle any disputes, and how to dissolve the partnership. 2. Legal Advice: It would be advisable to seek professional legal advice to understand the repercussions of dissolving the partnership and to help navigate the process ahead. 3. Agreement Breach: If your partner breached the terms of your agreement as you suggested, document all instances where this occurred. This evidence could be important when negotiating the dissolution of the partnership or in any potential legal proceedings. 4. Goodwill: Goodwill refers to the reputation and relations with customers and suppliers that the enterprise has built over time and is often seen as an intangible asset. Your partner may have built some of this as well, so legal advice should be taken to understand any potential claims to it. 5. Financial Audit: It seems appropriate to have a thorough accounting of the company's assets and liabilities, conducted by a professional accountant. This will help in determining what assets, if any, need to be divided. 6. Continuation of Business: If you plan on continuing the business alone, there may be options to purchase your partner's share of the company. Legal advice should help you consider the options available and note that you might have to negotiate terms with your partner. 7. Emotional Considerations: Emotional blackmail can make any situation more difficult. Remember that, while it's natural to be sympathetic towards your partner's personal struggles, your business decisions need to be focused on what's best for the business and your own wellbeing. Lastly, these are stressful situations and it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. Be sure to take care of your mental health and consider seeking support or counselling to help you through this difficult period. Good luck. Please remember that this advice is very general. Always speak to a professional for precise help.

I'm sorry to hear about the challenges you're facing in your partnership. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I do recommend you consult with a legal professional in your jurisdiction for advice tailored to your specific scenario. However, let's try to navigate through the broad points based on your description. 1. Dissolution of Partnership: A partnership is dissolved when any partner ceases to be a part of it. If you expel your partner, this would mean dissolving the current partnership. However, it doesn’t mean the end of the business. You could continue operating the business as a sole trader or form a new partnership with someone else or even establish a limited company. 2. Goodwill: The partner leaving the partnership usually has no claim on the 'goodwill' of the business, unless your partnership agreement states otherwise. Goodwill usually applies when a business is bought out. 3. Misappropriation of Funds: This is a serious matter; under the partnership agreement, duties of good faith are fundamental. You might consider reporting this to the relevant authorities after taking advice in context of your specific situation. 4. Intellectual Property: Unless stated otherwise in your agreement, the partnership owns the assets, including intellectual property. If your partner leaves they should not be able to use the name or branding of the existing business. 5. Name and Business Continuity: As your partner leaves, you may need to update the business name (if it included your partner's name) and let your customers, suppliers and other parties know that your partner is no longer affiliated with the business. 6. Debt and Liability: With a general partnership, both partners are jointly and severally liable for debts and obligations. If your partner leaves, they still have an obligation towards the debts incurred whilst they were a partner. 7. Final Settlement: A final accounting would need to be done to ascertain what the outgoing partner is owed in terms of their sharing of the partnership assets. This would include the misappropriated funds being accounted for. It's crucial you seek a professional legal counsel to advise you on the precise steps you need to take, in accordance with laws and regulations specific to your jurisdiction. This information is only broad guidance and not a specific legal advice.

## Question 14

*Text of Q14*: I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?

I'm not a financial advisor, but I can offer some general information that may help in your situation. When winding up your limited business, it is important to prioritize the payment of your debts. Here are some steps you could consider: 1. Determine your legal obligations: Ensure that you check your legal obligations regarding outstanding debts, such as any contracted services. 2. Directors' loans: If there are any outstanding directors' loans, it is generally advisable to repay them if possible, as they can be considered personal debts of the directors. 3. Essential services: Utility bills, such as energy, water, and broadband, are usually considered essential, and it is important to prioritize paying them to avoid any disruptions to your personal or future business needs. 4. Outstanding rent: If you've agreed with your landlord to vacate the premises quickly and they were understanding of your financial situation, it would be best to contact them and arrange a payment plan. As you mentioned they were okay with you not being able to pay the rent initially, they might be more open to collaborating on a solution. 5. Remaining funds: Once you have prioritized the essential services and directors' loans, you will need to allocate any remaining funds to the other debts you owe. It may be worth contacting your creditors to discuss your financial situation openly and negotiate repayment plans if necessary. Some creditors may be willing to accept reduced payments or provide a repayment holiday given the circumstances. If you are unable to pay all of your debts in full, you may need to seek professional advice from a financial advisor, accountant, or insolvency practitioner. They can assess your specific situation and provide guidance on the best course of action. Please note that this response is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial or legal advice. Consulting with a professional is always recommended in such situations.

I'm an AI by OpenAI and not a financial adviser, but I can provide some general guidance based on common practices. It's crucial to approach this matter ethically, transparently and lawfully. You must comply with the Insolvency Act 1986 and other associated laws when closing your company, ensuring that creditors are treated equally: 1. Utility providers: As a general rule, utility providers shouldn't be too stringent about payment arrangements provided you keep them informed and demonstrate a willingness to pay. Prioritise paying off your electricity, gas, and water bills if possible. This might include setting up a payment plan to manage any debt over time. 2. Broadband: Similar to energy providers, it's advisable to make arrangements to pay off any outstanding balance on your broadband account. 3. Director Loans: These loans are typically repaid after the creditors in the event a company liquidates. However, if there have been overdrawn director’s loans, HMRC can treat these as income and tax them accordingly. 4. Landlord: Even though your landlord has been understanding, ensure that all terms of your lease are met or a mutually beneficial agreement is reached. If your utility providers aren't completely paid, they may involve debt collectors, which could have a negative impact on your personal and business credit rating. It's important you take advice from a licensed accountant or insolvency practitioner who can guide you through the legal aspects based on your company's specific financial state. They can help you understand creditors' rights and the implications in the order of payments in case of insolvency. In this kind of situation, communication is key. Keep all creditors informed about your situation and your plans for payment - most companies would rather arrange a payment plan than go through the hassle of legal proceedings. Again, this is just general advice, and individual cases can vary significantly. It is important you seek advice from a professional to understand your obligations and the best course of action.

As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I can provide you with some general guidance about prioritizing your payments in the winding up process of your limited business. However, please note that this advice is not a substitute for professional legal advice. I recommend consulting with an insolvency practitioner or a qualified insolvency lawyer for specific advice tailored to your situation. In the winding up process, there is a specific order of priority for distributing the assets of the company. This order of priority is set out in the Insolvency Act 1986 and includes the following categories: 1. Fixed charge holders: If you have any secured creditors who have a fixed charge over specific assets of your company, they will have first priority to those assets. 2. Costs and expenses of the winding up: Any costs and expenses incurred in the winding up process, including professional fees and the costs of the liquidation, will have priority before other debts. 3. Preferential creditors: Certain creditors, such as employees with outstanding wages and certain tax authorities, may have preferential status and will be paid before unsecured creditors. 4. Floating charge holders: If there are any creditors with a floating charge over the company's assets, they will have priority to those assets after the costs and expenses of the winding up and preferential creditors have been paid. 5. Unsecured creditors: Unsecured creditors, such as suppliers and trade creditors, will generally be paid next in line, after the costs and expenses of the winding up, the preferential creditors, and the floating charge holders have been satisfied. Please note that the actual distribution and priority of payments may depend on the specific circumstances of your case and any relevant agreements or arrangements. As for your specific situation, it

Given the complexity of your situation, I'd like to firstly stress that you should seek legal advice from a solvency practitioner or an experienced solicitor because the solution will depend on the finer details of your situation. However, assuming that your business is based in England, I can provide some general guidance. First, you should try to formally wind down your company, which involves various legal processes. One of the options is voluntary liquidation: You could proceed with a Members’ Voluntary Liquidation (MVL) if your company is solvent (i.e., it can pay its bills). However, as you have indicated that there are debts that your company can’t pay, a more appropriate option might be a Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation (CVL). Before initiating either, you must hold a board meeting to agree to wind up the company and declare that you've examined the company's affairs and believe the company will be able to pay its debts. You should record this decision in meeting minutes. To start a CVL, there are also additional steps, including a vote of at least 75% in favour from your creditors. You must also inform Companies House within a week of the resolution to wind-up by sending form LIQ06. When you start liquidation, the liquidator takes control of the company. They dispose of assets, collect money owed, and distribute funds to pay creditors and company members. Debts are usually paid in this order: 1. Secured creditors with a fixed charge 2. Liquidator's fees and expenses 3. Preferential creditors (this includes employee wages if you had any) 4. Creditors with a floating charge 5. Unsecured creditors 6. Shareholders The £600 left in your business account will be part of this and be used to pay towards settling these. Once the liquidation process is complete, the company will be shut down and thereafter it doesn't exist. The Insolvency Act 1986 contains provisions limiting the extent of directors' liability. You should note that the liquidator also investigates the affairs of the company and the conduct of its directors. If they find evidence of wrongful or fraudulent trading or that you've breached your duties as a director, you could be held personally accountable for some or all of the company's debts. Finally, remember that this is only a guide. This is a complex process with legal obligations. You should find an experienced insolvency practitioner to assist you through the process. As for your direct debits, you can cancel them with your bank but please inform the respective companies in advance. Regarding any leases or contracts including your rental agreement, revise them to ensure you are aware what the terms of early termination are. While exiting a business can be a difficult process, it's important to navigate it properly as dissolving a company correctly can protect you from future liabilities and unwanted legal challenges.
