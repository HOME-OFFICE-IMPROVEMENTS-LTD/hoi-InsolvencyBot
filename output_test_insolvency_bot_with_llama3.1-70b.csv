Q1	I set up a limited liability company in 2015. My business suffered greatly during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it still hasn’t recovered yet. I fell into arrears, and one of my suppliers submitted a winding-up petition against my business. A friend of mine is willing to invest money in my company. Do I have good chances of avoiding a liquidation order if my friend commits to pumping money into my business?	I understand your situation, and I'll provide you with helpful advice. Given that your business has been struggling due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and a winding-up petition has been submitted against your company, it's essential to consider the relevant laws and case law. In Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch), the court held that a company must demonstrate that the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on its financial situation to prevent a winding-up petition. However, in your case, it seems that the pandemic has indeed affected your business. To avoid a liquidation order, you may want to consider the following options: 1. **Moratorium**: Under Insolvency Act 1986 section A4, you can apply for a moratorium, which would give your company a temporary reprieve from creditor action. This could provide time for your friend's investment to be implemented and for the company to recover. 2. **Investment and restructuring**: If your friend is willing to invest in your company, you may be able to demonstrate to the court that the company has a viable future and can pay its debts. This could be achieved by presenting a restructuring plan, which would need to be approved by the court. 3. **Disputing the winding-up petition**: You may want to dispute the winding-up petition on the grounds that the company is not insolvent or that the petition is an abuse of process. However, this would require strong evidence and a solid legal argument. In terms of the relevant statutes, Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 provides that a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it has failed to pay a debt exceeding £750 within 3 weeks of a written demand. However, if your friend's investment can be used to pay off this debt, you may be able to argue that the company is not insolvent. Additionally, Companies House Form LIQ03 can be used to give notice of a progress report in a voluntary winding-up, which may be relevant if you decide to pursue a voluntary winding-up instead of contesting the petition. It's essential to note that the court's primary concern is the interests of the creditors. Therefore, you will need to demonstrate that the proposed investment and restructuring plan will benefit the creditors and ensure that the company can pay its debts. I recommend that you seek the advice of a qualified insolvency lawyer to discuss your options in more detail and to determine the best course of action for your company.	5.869454622268677	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 208 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A4 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	"Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch) (Coronavirus; Winding-up petition)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q2	My business has been running at a deficit for a few years. In 2021, I got a loan from NatWest to stay afloat. I have given my share in the family home (50%) as a collateral for this loan. I am now unable to repay it. What should I do? Can the bank repossess my house?	I can see that you're in a difficult situation with your business. Given that you've been running at a deficit for a few years and are now unable to repay the loan from NatWest, it's essential to consider your options carefully. Firstly, it's crucial to understand that the bank can repossess your house if you fail to repay the loan, as you've given your share in the family home (50%) as collateral. This is a significant risk, and you should seek professional advice to mitigate this risk. In terms of your business, you may want to consider the following options: 1. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: A CVA is a procedure that allows your company to reach a binding agreement with its creditors to pay off a proportion of its debts over time. This could help you avoid liquidation and potentially save your business. 2. **Administration**: If your company is insolvent, you may want to consider entering into administration. This would involve appointing an administrator to take control of your company and try to rescue it as a going concern. 3. **Liquidation**: If your company is no longer viable, you may need to consider liquidation. This would involve winding up your company and distributing its assets to creditors. It's essential to note that these options have different implications for your business, and you should seek professional advice to determine the best course of action. In terms of your personal situation, you may want to consider the following: 1. **Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)**: An IVA is a procedure that allows you to reach a binding agreement with your creditors to pay off a proportion of your debts over time. This could help you avoid bankruptcy and potentially save your home. 2. **Bankruptcy**: If you're unable to pay your debts, you may need to consider bankruptcy. This would involve surrendering your assets to a trustee, who would distribute them to your creditors. Again, these options have different implications for your personal situation, and you should seek professional advice to determine the best course of action. In light of the above, I would recommend that you seek advice from a qualified insolvency practitioner or a solicitor who specializes in insolvency law. They can help you navigate the complex legal landscape and determine the best course of action for your business and personal situation. Additionally, you may want to consider the following: * **Companies House Form DS02**: Use this form to withdraw your company's striking off application, if applicable. * **Companies House Form SH01**: Use this form to give notice of shares allotted following incorporation, if applicable. * **Companies House Form MT03**: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early, if applicable.

Q3	My business (a small restaurant in Egham) is saddled with debt towards several suppliers. I do have a loyal customer base, but I feel that I need to reduce my debt burden. My brother offered to buy my business for a fair price, and he also told me he would like to retain me and some of my employees. However, he says that I need to deal with my debt before selling the business to him. I don’t have savings. What can I do?	I understand your situation, and I'm here to provide you with some guidance. Given your debt burden and the offer from your brother, it's essential to consider your options carefully. Firstly, it's crucial to assess the financial situation of your business. You may want to prepare a statement of affairs, which is a document that outlines the company's assets, liabilities, and financial position. This will help you understand the extent of your debt and identify potential areas for cost-cutting or restructuring. You can use Companies House Form LIQ02 to give notice of a statement of affairs. Considering your brother's offer, it's essential to ensure that the sale of the business is done in a way that complies with the Insolvency Act 1986. You should be aware of the anti-deprivation principle, which was discussed in the case of Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38. This principle aims to prevent companies from avoiding their debts by transferring assets or entering into agreements that would deprive creditors of their rights. To address your debt burden, you may want to consider a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) or an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), depending on your personal circumstances. A CVA is a procedure that allows a company to reach a binding agreement with its creditors to pay off a proportion of its debts over time. An IVA is a similar procedure for individuals. However, if your business is insolvent, and you're unable to pay your debts, you may need to consider liquidation. This is a formal process where a liquidator is appointed to wind up the company's affairs and distribute its assets to creditors. You can use Companies House Form RT01 to apply to restore your company if it's been struck off the register. It's also important to note that as a director, you have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. The case of BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) highlights the importance of directors' duties in insolvency situations. In terms of your brother's offer, it's essential to ensure that the sale of the business is done at a fair price and that all creditors are treated fairly. You may want to consider seeking independent advice to ensure that the sale is conducted in a way that complies with the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Companies Act 2006. Lastly, you should be aware of the potential consequences of not addressing your debt burden. If your business is wound up, you may be personally liable for some of the debts, and your credit rating could be affected. I recommend seeking advice from a qualified insolvency practitioner or a solicitor who specializes in insolvency law to help you navigate this complex situation. They can provide you with personalized guidance and help you make an informed decision about the best course of action for your business. Additionally, you may want to consider the following: * Insolvency Act 1986 section 123: This section sets out the grounds for winding up a company, including the inability to pay debts. * Insolvency Act 1986 section 124: This section outlines the procedure for winding up a company. * Insolvency Act 1986 section 149: This section deals with the payment of debts and the distribution of assets in a winding-up scenario. * Companies Act 2006 section 154: This section sets out the requirements for company directors. * Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986: This Act sets out the circumstances in which a director can be disqualified. * Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016: These rules provide guidance on the insolvency process in England and Wales. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list, and you should seek professional advice to ensure that you're complying with all relevant laws and regulations.	7.502800941467285	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 149 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q4	I own a pub in Windsor. I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, by additional taxes on alcohol as well as by a reduction in my customer base. I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). I reached an agreement with my bank and with most of my suppliers to delay the repayment of my debt. The HMRC won’t listen and they are threatening legal actions against me. What can I do? HMRC counts for roughly 50% of my unsecured debt (the debt towards the bank is secured by a collateral on my pub).	I understand your situation, and I'll provide you with some helpful advice. Given the circumstances, it's essential to address the HMRC's concerns and explore options to manage your debt. Firstly, I recommend that you seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in corporate insolvency. They can help you navigate the situation and provide guidance on the best course of action. Considering your agreement with the bank and most suppliers to delay repayment, it's crucial to demonstrate to HMRC that you're taking proactive steps to manage your debt. You may want to consider proposing a Time to Pay (TTP) arrangement with HMRC, which could allow you to pay your tax debts in installments over a period of time. However, if HMRC is unwilling to negotiate, you may need to consider more formal insolvency procedures. Given that HMRC accounts for roughly 50% of your unsecured debt, it's essential to explore options that can help you manage this debt. One possible option is to consider a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). A CVA is a formal agreement between your company and its creditors, which can help you restructure your debt and avoid liquidation. However, this would require the approval of at least 75% of your creditors, including HMRC. Another option could be to consider a moratorium under the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020. This would provide your company with a temporary breathing space to restructure its debt and avoid creditor action. However, this would require the approval of the court and would need to be carefully considered in light of your company's specific circumstances. It's also essential to ensure that you're complying with your duties as a director, particularly in relation to the Companies Act 2006 section 172, which requires directors to act in the best interests of the company. You should also be aware of the potential risks of wrongful trading under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 214. In terms of relevant case law, the decision in Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 may be relevant, as it highlights the importance of good faith and commercial sense in the application of the anti-deprivation principle. Additionally, the decision in Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) may be relevant, as it provides guidance on the notion of insolvency and the importance of considering both cash flow and balance sheet tests. In terms of Companies House forms, you may need to consider filing a Form MT02 to notify Companies House of an extension to a moratorium for your company, or a Form MT03 to notify Companies House that a moratorium has ended early. I hope this advice is helpful, and I strongly recommend that you seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in corporate insolvency to ensure that you're taking the best course of action for your company.	7.03988242149353	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A28 (Moratorium)|Companies Act 2006 section 899A (Arrangements and reconstructions: general])|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251G (Debt relief orders)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q5	I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, as well as by a reduction in my customer base (I run a pub in Ascot). I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). My landlord is demanding an extortionate amount of money for my rent. While I agreed to a new, 5-year leasing agreement, I realised that I am operating at a loss unless my rent is reduced and the HMRC agrees to a repayment plan. What can I do?	I can see that you're facing a challenging situation with your pub business in Ascot. Given the rise in interest rates, reduction in customer base, and arrears in payments to HMRC and suppliers, it's essential to take proactive steps to address these issues. Firstly, I recommend that you seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a corporate restructuring expert to assess your company's financial situation and explore available options. Considering your situation, you may want to consider the following: 1. **HMRC Repayment Plan**: You can approach HMRC to discuss a repayment plan, known as a Time to Pay (TTP) arrangement. This may allow you to pay off your tax debts in installments, rather than in a lump sum. You can use Form CP14 to apply for a TTP arrangement. 2. **Supplier Negotiations**: Reach out to your suppliers and explain your situation. They may be willing to negotiate a payment plan or accept a reduced payment. Be transparent about your financial difficulties and provide evidence to support your claims. 3. **Landlord Negotiations**: Regarding your landlord's demands, you may want to consider negotiating a rent reduction or a temporary rent holiday. You can use the current market conditions and your financial situation as leverage to renegotiate the terms of your lease. 4. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: If you're unable to pay your debts, you may want to consider a CVA. This is a formal agreement between your company and its creditors to pay off a proportion of the debts over time. A CVA can help you avoid liquidation and give your business a chance to recover. 5. **Administration or Pre-Pack Administration**: If your company is insolvent, you may want to consider entering administration or a pre-pack administration. This can provide a temporary moratorium on creditor action, allowing you to restructure your business or sell it to a new owner. In terms of relevant statutes and case law, you may want to consider the following: * **Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38**: This case highlights the importance of good faith and commercial sense in contractual arrangements. You may want to consider whether your lease agreement or supplier contracts can be renegotiated or restructured in good faith. * **BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)**: This case emphasizes the importance of directors' duties and good faith in decision-making. As a director, you have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of your company and its creditors. * **Oceanfill Ltd v Nuffield Health Wellbeing Ltd [2022] EWHC 2178 (Ch)**: This case highlights the importance of considering the interests of all stakeholders, including creditors and guarantors, when restructuring a business. In terms of Companies House forms, you may want to consider the following: * **Companies House Form LIQ03**: This form is used to give notice of a progress report in a voluntary winding-up. If you're considering liquidation, you'll need to file this form with Companies House. * **Companies House Form RT01**: This form is used to apply to Companies House to restore a company that has been dissolved. If you're considering restoring your company, you'll need to file this form with Companies House. * **Companies House Form MT03**: This form is used to notify Companies House that a moratorium has ended early. If you're considering entering a moratorium, you'll need to file this form with Companies House. I hope this advice is helpful. Please note that this is not a substitute for professional advice, and you should consult with an insolvency practitioner or a corporate restructuring expert to discuss your specific situation and options.	12.346850633621216	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 222 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)|Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 224 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Oceanfill Ltd v Nuffield Health Wellbeing Ltd [2022] EWHC 2178 (Ch) (Business restructuring; Debt restructuring; Guarantors; Schemes of arrangement; Summary judgments)	Companies House Form LIQ03: Use this form to give notice of progress report in voluntary winding up.|Companies House Form RT01: Use this form to apply to Companies House to get your company restored.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.
Q6	I am a real estate developer. Due to the current housing crisis, my mortgages have ballooned, and I am struggling to make money out of the sale of the properties I recently completed. While my housing portfolio is significant, most properties are not yet ready for the market. I am not paying all my suppliers, and the banks are chasing me multiple times per day. If they foreclose, I lose everything. If I complete all my projects, I can repay the banks and the suppliers. However, one of them just filed a petition for winding up my business. I refuse to believe I am insolvent. Is it likely that the petition will be dismissed?	I understand your concerns as a real estate developer facing financial difficulties. However, the fact that a petition for winding up has been filed against your business means that the court will have to assess whether your company is insolvent or not. To determine insolvency, the court will consider whether your company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due (cash flow test) or whether the value of your company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (balance sheet test) (Insolvency Act 1986, section 123). In your case, it appears that you are struggling to make payments to your suppliers and the banks are chasing you for payment. This suggests that you may be unable to pay your debts as they fall due, which could indicate insolvency. However, you argue that if you complete all your projects, you can repay the banks and the suppliers. This suggests that you may have a viable business plan, but it is uncertain whether this will be enough to convince the court that your company is not insolvent. In Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch), the court held that a company had failed to show that COVID-19 had financially affected its business so as to prevent a winding-up petition being made against it under the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 Sch.10. The petitioner had good reason to believe that the company's inability to pay its debt was unconnected with COVID-19. Further, the company had provided no evidence to make good its contention that COVID-19 had had an effect and that its business was not already doomed to fail. Similarly, in your case, the court may consider whether your company's financial difficulties are due to the current housing crisis or whether they are a result of poor management or other factors. To have the petition dismissed, you will need to provide evidence to the court that your company is not insolvent and that you have a viable plan to repay your debts. This may involve providing financial statements, business plans, and other evidence to demonstrate that your company is solvent. It is also worth noting that you may be able to apply for a moratorium under Insolvency Act 1986 section A4, which could give you some breathing space to restructure your business and avoid winding up. I would recommend seeking the advice of an insolvency lawyer who can help you navigate the process and provide guidance on the best course of action for your business. Additionally, you may want to consider using Companies House Form WU07 to give notice of a progress report in a winding-up by the court, or Companies House Form DS02 to withdraw your company's striking off application, or Companies House Form MT03 to tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early. It is also worth noting that as a director of the company, you have a duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. If the company is insolvent, you may be personally liable for any debts incurred after the company became insolvent (Companies Act 2006, section 174). I hope this helps, and I would be happy to provide further guidance and advice on this matter.	8.5394606590271	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A4 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 7.4 (WINDING UP BY THE COURT)	Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch) (Coronavirus; Winding-up petition)|Rushbrooke UK Ltd v 4 Design Concepts Ltd [2022] EWHC 1110 (Ch) (Cross-Border Insolvency; Authority; Directors; Injunctions; Statutory demands; Striking out; Winding-up petitions)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|One Blackfriars Ltd (in liq.), Re [2021] EWHC 684 (Ch) (Administration; Administrators' powers and duties; Conflict of interest; Valuation)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form WU07: Use this form to give notice of a progress report in a winding-up by the court.|Companies House Form DS02: Use this form to withdraw your company's striking off application.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.
Q7	My brother and I have been working together on our hand-made furniture shop for 20+ years. Last year, we had to liquidate the business because we could no longer pay the bills. An official receiver was appointed. Yesterday, he came back to us and asked to repay all the dividends we received in the 5 years before insolvency. This is a ridiculous amount of money (£150,000 each). My brother and I never received a salary. The official receiver says that we could not get any dividends because the business was operating at a loss. We were only paid in dividends to avoid income tax, and because my accountant told me that was fine. Surely, we don’t have to repay that money?	I can see that you and your brother are in a difficult situation. The official receiver is seeking to recover the dividends you received in the 5 years leading up to the insolvency of your business. The official receiver's claim is likely based on the argument that the dividends were paid out of the company's capital, rather than out of profits, and that this was in breach of the Companies Act 2006, specifically section 830 (formerly section 263 of the Companies Act 1985). This section prohibits a company from making a distribution (including a dividend) if the company's net assets are thereby reduced below the aggregate of its called-up share capital and undistributable reserves. However, it's worth noting that the official receiver will need to prove that the dividends were paid in breach of the Companies Act 2006, and that you and your brother knew or ought to have known that the company was insolvent at the time the dividends were paid. In your case, it seems that you and your brother were advised by your accountant that paying dividends was a legitimate way to avoid income tax. However, this advice may not be sufficient to defend against the official receiver's claim. You may want to consider seeking advice from a specialist insolvency lawyer who can review your case and advise on the best course of action. They may be able to argue that the dividends were paid in good faith, and that you and your brother did not knowingly breach the Companies Act 2006. Additionally, you may want to consider whether the official receiver's claim is time-barred. The Limitation Act 1980 sets out the time limits for bringing claims, and it's possible that the official receiver's claim may be outside of the relevant time limit. In terms of case law, the decision in Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 may be relevant. This case established that the anti-deprivation principle can be applied in certain circumstances to prevent a company from avoiding its debts. However, this principle is not directly applicable to your case, as the official receiver is not seeking to apply the anti-deprivation principle. The case of Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22 may also be relevant, as it established the principle of limited liability and the separate personality of a company. However, this case is not directly applicable to your situation, as the issue is not whether the company is liable for the debts, but rather whether you and your brother are liable to repay the dividends. In terms of Companies House forms, you may want to consider filing a Form REC1 to give notice of the official receiver's report, and a Form RM01 to give notice of the appointment of the official receiver. I hope this advice is helpful. However, please note that this is a complex area of law, and you should seek advice from a specialist insolvency lawyer to ensure that you receive the best possible advice for your situation.	6.265076160430908	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 399 (Public Administration (England and Wales))|Insolvency Act 1986 section 132 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 13.2 (OFFICIAL RECEIVER)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q8	My business went into liquidation last year. I was the owner and director. A liquidator was appointed. He is threatening to sue me for breaching my duties as a director unless I return the money I received as monthly repayments for a loan I gave to my company. He’s also threatening to start a disqualification procedure against me for the same reason. I believe I did nothing wrong – this was a fair loan with interests below the market rate. However, I cannot risk being disqualified, because I am also working as a director in my sister’s company. What can I do? Should I return the money?	I can see that you're in a difficult situation. As a director of your company, you have certain duties and responsibilities, and it's essential to understand the liquidator's concerns. The liquidator's primary goal is to maximize the recovery of assets for the benefit of the company's creditors. In this case, the liquidator is questioning the loan repayments you received from the company, suggesting that they may be considered a breach of your duties as a director. Under the Companies Act 2006, directors have a duty to act in the best interests of the company (section 172). This includes ensuring that the company's assets are used for the benefit of the company and its creditors, rather than for personal gain. The liquidator may be arguing that the loan repayments you received were not in the best interests of the company, particularly if the company was insolvent or facing financial difficulties at the time. The fact that the interest rate was below the market rate may be seen as a factor that supports this argument. Regarding the threat of disqualification, the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 allows the court to disqualify a director from acting as a director of any company for a period of up to 15 years if they are found to be unfit to be a director. This can be due to various reasons, including breach of duty, misfeasance, or other forms of misconduct. In your case, the liquidator may be considering a disqualification application under section 6 of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, which allows the court to disqualify a director who has been involved in the management of a company that has become insolvent. To address the liquidator's concerns, I would recommend the following steps: 1. Seek professional advice: Consult with a solicitor who specializes in insolvency and company law to understand the liquidator's concerns and the potential risks and consequences. 2. Review the loan agreement: Examine the loan agreement and the circumstances surrounding the loan repayments to determine whether they were reasonable and in the best interests of the company. 3. Gather evidence: Collect evidence to support your position, including financial records, board minutes, and any other relevant documents that demonstrate the loan repayments were legitimate and not a breach of your duties. 4. Negotiate with the liquidator: Attempt to negotiate with the liquidator to resolve the matter amicably. This may involve offering to repay some or all of the loan repayments, or providing additional information to address the liquidator's concerns. 5. Consider a settlement: If the liquidator is unwilling to negotiate, you may need to consider a settlement agreement to avoid the costs and risks associated with litigation. Regarding the question of whether you should return the money, it's essential to consider the following: * If you return the money, it may be seen as an admission of liability, which could impact your ability to defend against any future claims. * However, returning the money may also be seen as a gesture of good faith, which could help to resolve the matter amicably. Ultimately, the decision to return the money should be made in consultation with your solicitor, taking into account the specific circumstances of your case and the potential risks and consequences. In terms of the disqualification threat, it's essential to take this seriously and seek professional advice to understand the potential risks and consequences. If you are disqualified, it could have significant implications for your ability to act as a director of your sister's company or any other company in the future. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.	7.369421720504761	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 108 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 91 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 6.23 (CREDITORS' VOLUNTARY WINDING UP)	HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch) (Cash flows; Notion of insolvency; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidators' powers and duties; Misfeasance; Payments in insolvency)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Centralcrest Engineering Ltd, Re [1999] 9 W.L.U.K. 176 (Misconduct; Liquidators' duties; Misfeasance; Tortious liability; Trading)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.)

Q9	My business is operating at a loss. Chase Bank is my major lender, and they have a security over my home. I fell into arrears towards several suppliers, but I do believe I can turn around my business if I am given a bit more time to repay my debts. What can I do?	I understand that your business is facing financial difficulties, and you're seeking advice on how to navigate this challenging situation. Given that Chase Bank has a security over your home, it's essential to address the issue promptly to avoid any potential consequences. Firstly, I recommend that you communicate with Chase Bank and explain your situation. They may be willing to work with you to restructure your debt or provide temporary relief. However, it's crucial to be aware that they may also consider enforcing their security over your home if you fail to meet your repayment obligations. Considering your business is operating at a loss, it's essential to assess whether it's viable to continue trading. You may want to consider seeking professional advice from an accountant or a business advisor to help you create a turnaround plan. In the meantime, you should also be aware of the potential risks of wrongful trading. If you continue to trade while insolvent, you may be personally liable for any debts incurred during this period. It's essential to take steps to minimize any potential losses and ensure that you're not worsening the situation. Regarding your suppliers, it's crucial to communicate with them and explain your situation. They may be willing to work with you to restructure your debt or provide temporary relief. However, if you're unable to pay your debts, you may need to consider alternative options, such as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) or a Pre-Pack Administration. A CVA is a formal agreement between your company and its creditors to pay off a proportion of the debts over time. This can help you avoid liquidation and give you time to restructure your business. A Pre-Pack Administration is a process where your company is placed into administration, and a new company is formed to purchase the assets of the old company. This can help you avoid liquidation and give you a fresh start. It's essential to seek professional advice from a licensed insolvency practitioner to determine the best course of action for your business. They can help you assess your situation, create a turnaround plan, and explore alternative options to ensure the best possible outcome. In terms of relevant statute, you should be aware of the following: * Insolvency Act 1986 section 123: This section sets out the grounds for winding up a company, including the inability to pay debts. * Insolvency Act 1986 section 124: This section sets out the procedure for presenting a winding-up petition. * Companies Act 2006 section 226C: This section sets out the rules for payment for loss of office. * Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986: This act sets out the rules for disqualifying directors. * Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016: These rules set out the procedures for insolvency proceedings.

Q10	My business went into liquidation last March. I tried my best to avoid it. I may have preferred some creditors over others, but simply because they knew I was struggling, and they would not give me their products on credit. I may also have taken some money out of the business account to repay the mortgage on my house. Surely, I did nothing wrong? Do I risk anything?	I'm so sorry to hear that your business went into liquidation. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I must advise you that your actions, although possibly well-intentioned, may have implications under insolvency law. Firstly, preferring certain creditors over others may be considered a breach of the pari passu principle, which requires that all unsecured creditors be treated equally in the distribution of assets. This principle is enshrined in the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, Rule 14.12. However, it's essential to note that the court may take into account the circumstances surrounding the payments, including the fact that you were trying to keep the business afloat. Secondly, taking money out of the business account to repay your mortgage may be considered a transaction at an undervalue, as per the Insolvency Act 1986, section 238. This section allows the liquidator to challenge transactions that were entered into at an undervalue, with the intention of preferring one creditor over others. The court may consider whether the transaction was made with the intention of putting assets beyond the reach of creditors. It's also worth noting that, as a director, you have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. The case of BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) highlights the importance of directors considering the interests of creditors when making decisions. In light of these potential issues, I would recommend that you: 1. Seek advice from a qualified insolvency practitioner or lawyer to discuss the specifics of your situation. 2. Cooperate fully with the liquidator and provide any requested information or documentation. 3. Be prepared to explain the circumstances surrounding the payments to preferred creditors and the transaction at an undervalue. It's essential to remember that the liquidator's primary goal is to maximize the recovery of assets for the benefit of all creditors. If you have acted in good faith and can demonstrate that your actions were taken to try to save the business, the court may take a more lenient view. However, if the liquidator or the court determines that you have breached your fiduciary duties or engaged in transactions that were detrimental to the creditors, you may face personal liability, including potential disqualification as a director under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require further guidance or representation.	6.630582094192505	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 188 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 247 (Interpretation for First Group of Parts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Marches Credit Union Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 1731 (Ch) (Liquidation; Locus standi; Petitions; Union)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form LIQ06: Use this form to give notice of a liquidator's resignation in members' voluntary liquidation or creditors' voluntary liquidation.|Companies House Form AM22: Use this form to give notice of a move from administration to creditors' voluntary liquidation.
Q11	My life-long partner just left me for an Italian scugnizzo who is 15 years younger than her. What’s worse is that before leaving, she emptied our joint business account and she stopped paying the joint mortgage we have on our business. The bank is threatening legal actions against me, and to foreclose on the business property. What can I do? By the way, I cannot contact my (ex) partner but I believe she’s now in Italy with her new partner.	I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. Given the circumstances, it's essential to act quickly to protect your interests and the business. Here's a step-by-step plan to help you navigate this challenging situation: 1. **Seek professional advice**: Consult with a corporate insolvency lawyer, an accountant, and a financial advisor to get a comprehensive understanding of your situation. They can help you assess the financial implications and provide guidance on the best course of action. 2. **Assess the financial situation**: Review the company's financial statements, including the joint business account and the mortgage. Determine the extent of the financial damage caused by your partner's actions. 3. **Contact the bank**: Reach out to the bank and explain the situation. They may be willing to work with you to find a solution, such as a temporary payment plan or a restructuring of the mortgage. Be prepared to provide financial information and a plan for how you intend to rectify the situation. 4. **Consider a winding-up petition**: If the company is insolvent, you may need to consider presenting a winding-up petition to the court. This would allow you to take control of the company's assets and liabilities, and potentially prevent further financial damage. (Insolvency Act 1986, section 124) 5. **Look into cross-border insolvency**: Since your partner is now in Italy, you may need to consider cross-border insolvency proceedings. This can be complex, so it's essential to work with a lawyer who has experience in this area. (Re Entertainment Ltd [2016] EWHC 1545 (Ch)) 6. **Explore options for recovering the misappropriated funds**: You may be able to recover the funds taken by your partner through a transaction at an undervalue claim. This would require you to demonstrate that the transfer of funds was made with the intention of defeating the company's creditors. (Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice [1995] 1 W.L.R. 1238) 7. **Review your director's duties**: As a director, you have fiduciary duties to the company. Ensure that you are acting in the best interests of the company and its creditors. (BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)) 8. **Consider a moratorium**: If the company is facing financial difficulties, you may be able to apply for a moratorium to give you time to restructure the business or find a buyer. (Companies House Form MT03) 9. **Keep records and communicate with stakeholders**: Maintain accurate records of all financial transactions, communications, and decisions made during this period. Keep stakeholders, including the bank, creditors, and employees, informed about the situation and any developments. 10. **Seek support**: Lastly, don't forget to take care of yourself during this challenging time. Seek support from friends, family, or a professional counselor if needed. Remember, the key to navigating this situation is to act quickly, seek professional advice, and prioritize the interests of the company and its creditors.	7.536741495132446	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251R (Debt relief orders)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 365 (Bankruptcy)	Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice [1995] 1 W.L.R. 1238 (Directors' duties and powers; Misconduct; Transactions at an undervalue)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Re Entertainment Ltd [2016] EWHC 1545 (Ch) (Cross-Border Insolvency; Centre of main interests; Cross-border insolvency; Foreign proceedings)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form DS01: Use this service to apply to strike off a company from the Companies House register.

Q12	After Brexit, I set up a business in the Netherlands. This is a limited liability company. I am the sole director of that company. There are no employees in the Netherlands, just some people I hire occasionally to load and unload the lorries that distribute my products to the rest of Europe. I have now decided to stop selling goods to Europe, because it is not profitable. I want to wind-up the business here in the UK. Can I do it?	I can't provide legal advice, but I can provide general information about the process of winding up a company in the UK. Would that help? To wind up a company in the UK, you will need to follow the procedures set out in the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016. As the sole director of the company, you will need to take the following steps: 1. Check if the company is solvent or insolvent: If the company is solvent, you can wind it up voluntarily. If it is insolvent, you will need to follow the compulsory liquidation procedure. 2. Prepare a statement of affairs: This is a document that sets out the company's assets, liabilities, and financial position. 3. Call a meeting of the shareholders: You will need to call a meeting of the shareholders to pass a resolution to wind up the company. 4. Appoint a liquidator: You will need to appoint a liquidator to manage the winding-up process. 5. Notify the relevant authorities: You will need to notify Companies House, HMRC, and any other relevant authorities of the company's intention to wind up. It's also important to note that as a director, you have a duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. You should seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor to ensure that you are following the correct procedures and meeting your obligations as a director. Additionally, you should be aware of the potential consequences of winding up a company, including the possibility of being disqualified as a director under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. In your case, since the company is a Dutch company, you may need to follow the winding-up procedures in the Netherlands, rather than the UK. You should seek advice from a Dutch lawyer or insolvency practitioner to ensure that you are following the correct procedures. It's also worth noting that the case law you mentioned, such as Bristol Airport Plc v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744, Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34, and McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch), may not be directly applicable to your situation, as they relate to different areas of law. However, they may be relevant in certain circumstances, and you should seek advice from a qualified lawyer to determine their applicability to your case. Companies House forms, such as Form IC01, Form RR02, and Form MR06, may also be relevant to your situation, but you should seek advice from a qualified lawyer to determine which forms are applicable to your case. I hope this information is helpful. However, please note that this is not a substitute for professional advice, and you should seek advice from a qualified lawyer or insolvency practitioner to ensure that you are following the correct procedures and meeting your obligations as a director.	7.695448875427246	1	Companies Act 2006 section 3 (General introductory provisions)|Companies Act 2006 section 58 (A company's name)|Companies Act 2006 section 59 (A company's name)	Bristol Airport Plc v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744 (Administration; Liens; Security)|Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34 (Piercing the corporate veil; Limited liability)|McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)	Companies House Form IC01: Us this form to give notice of the intention to carry on business as an investment company.|Companies House Form RR02: This form is for public companies to re-register as a private limited company.|Companies House Form MR06: Use this form to register a statement of a company acting as a trustee after a charge created on or after 6 April 2013 has been registered.
