Q1	I set up a limited liability company in 2015. My business suffered greatly during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it still hasn’t recovered yet. I fell into arrears, and one of my suppliers submitted a winding-up petition against my business. A friend of mine is willing to invest money in my company. Do I have good chances of avoiding a liquidation order if my friend commits to pumping money into my business?	If your friend is willing to invest in your company, this could indeed help you avoid a liquidation order, but several factors need to be considered: Key Points to Consider: 1. Timing - You must act quickly before the court hearing - The investment needs to be readily available, not just promised 2. Amount of Investment - The investment should be sufficient to: - Pay off the petitioning creditor - Address other outstanding debts - Demonstrate business viability 3. Opposing the Petition You can oppose the winding-up petition by showing: - The business is solvent with new investment - There's a genuine dispute about the debt - You have a viable plan for business recovery Recommendations: 1. Get the investment agreement in writing 2. Consider seeking professional insolvency advice 3. Negotiate with the petitioning creditor 4. Present a clear business recovery plan to the court Remember: The court will need to be convinced that your business is viable and can pay its debts as they fall due with the new investment. It would be advisable to consult with an insolvency practitioner or solicitor for specific guidance on your situation.	5.534358263015747	1	"[["" Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

Q2	My business has been running at a deficit for a few years. In 2021, I got a loan from NatWest to stay afloat. I have given my share in the family home (50%) as a collateral for this loan. I am now unable to repay it. What should I do? Can the bank repossess my house?	If you're struggling to repay your NatWest loan, here are some important steps and considerations: 1. Contact NatWest immediately: - Don't wait until you miss payments - Banks prefer to work with customers who communicate proactively - They may offer payment holidays or restructured payment plans 2. Seek professional advice: - Contact a free debt advice service like StepChange or Citizens Advice - Consider consulting an insolvency practitioner - Speak with a financial advisor 3. Regarding your home: - Since your share is used as collateral, the bank can potentially take legal action - However, they typically view repossession as a last resort - They cannot repossess without a court order - Your spouse's 50% share is protected Possible solutions: - Debt management plan - Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) - Refinancing options - Selling assets to repay the loan - Voluntary sale of the property (better than forced repossession) It's crucial to act quickly and seek professional advice for your specific situation.	4.984206438064575	1	"[["" Does the lawyer outline the rules on the distribution of assets in insolvency (s.107 IA 1986 and following)?"", "" Does the lawyer outlines that secured creditors do not share pari passu, but they are paid in priority on the proceeds generated by the sale of secured assets?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the difference between fixed and floating charges?"", "" Does the lawyer clarify that the bank is likely to have a fixed charge over the debtor\u2019s family home?"", "" Does the lawyer clarify that the debtor cannot transfer his equity to their partner to prevent repossession from the bank?"", "" Does the lawyer mention that the security may not be enforceable should the lender not have complied with the rules regulating either their activity as lender or the registration of charges?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]"	3	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	24	No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q3	My business (a small restaurant in Egham) is saddled with debt towards several suppliers. I do have a loyal customer base, but I feel that I need to reduce my debt burden. My brother offered to buy my business for a fair price, and he also told me he would like to retain me and some of my employees. However, he says that I need to deal with my debt before selling the business to him. I don’t have savings. What can I do?	There are several options you could consider in this situation: 1. Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA): - This is a formal agreement with creditors to pay all or part of your debts - Allows you to make affordable monthly payments - Usually lasts 5-6 years - Protects you from creditor action 2. Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA): - Similar to IVA but for limited companies - Allows you to continue trading while paying debts - Need to work with an insolvency practitioner 3. Negotiate with creditors: - Contact suppliers directly to arrange payment plans - Some might accept reduced settlements - Get agreements in writing 4. Asset refinancing: - If you own equipment or property, you might be able to use these as security for a loan - Could help consolidate debts 5. Professional advice: - Consult with an insolvency practitioner - Speak with a business debt advisor - Get legal advice about the sale It would be advisable to seek professional advice to understand the best option for your specific situation. Many organisations offer free initial consultations: - Business Debtline - Citizens Advice - Local business support organisations Remember that any solution should be properly documented to protect both you and your brother in the business sale.	5.238194465637207	1	"[["" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different rescue options available under the Insolvency Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different restructuring options available under the Companies Act 2006?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the pros and cons of each of these options, and provide advice on the most suitable solution?"", "" Does the lawyer suggest the use of a pre-packaged administration procedure?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the changes introduced by the Administration (Restrictions on Disposal etc. to Connected Persons) Regulations 2021"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3]]"	7	[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	Yes|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q4	I own a pub in Windsor. I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, by additional taxes on alcohol as well as by a reduction in my customer base. I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). I reached an agreement with my bank and with most of my suppliers to delay the repayment of my debt. The HMRC won’t listen and they are threatening legal actions against me. What can I do? HMRC counts for roughly 50% of my unsecured debt (the debt towards the bank is secured by a collateral on my pub).	Given your situation, here are several options you might consider: 1. Time To Pay (TTP) Arrangement - Try negotiating a Time To Pay arrangement with HMRC - This allows you to pay your tax debt in installments - Contact HMRC's Business Payment Support Service - Be prepared with a detailed business plan and cash flow forecast 2. Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) - This is a formal agreement with creditors to pay debts over time - Allows you to continue trading while managing debt - Requires 75% of creditors (by value) to agree - Provides protection from creditor actions - Can include HMRC debt 3. Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) - Similar to CVA but for sole traders - Formal agreement to pay debts over typically 5 years - Must be set up through an Insolvency Practitioner 4. Professional Help - Consult an Insolvency Practitioner immediately - They can: - Assess your situation - Negotiate with HMRC - Recommend the best course of action - Help implement a formal solution if needed 5. Debt Advice - Contact free debt advice organizations like: - Business Debtline - Citizens Advice - Step Change Given that HMRC represents 50% of your unsecured debt, a CVA or IVA might be particularly suitable. Act quickly to prevent HMRC from taking legal action, as this could lead to more serious consequences.	5.83967137336731	1	"[["" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different rescue options available under the Insolvency Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different restructuring options available under the Companies Act 2006?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the pros and cons of each of these options, and provide advice on the most suitable solution?"", "" Does the lawyer suggest the use of Part 26A restructuring plans?"", "" Does the lawyer speak of the ability of cramming down dissenting creditors in a Part 26A plan, and the conditions for doing it?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3]]"	7	[4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	Yes|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q5	I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, as well as by a reduction in my customer base (I run a pub in Ascot). I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). My landlord is demanding an extortionate amount of money for my rent. While I agreed to a new, 5-year leasing agreement, I realised that I am operating at a loss unless my rent is reduced and the HMRC agrees to a repayment plan. What can I do?	This is a challenging situation that many business owners are facing. Here are some potential steps you could take: 1. HMRC Debt: - Contact HMRC immediately to discuss a Time to Pay (TTP) arrangement - Be prepared with detailed financial information and a realistic payment proposal - HMRC is often willing to negotiate if you're proactive and transparent 2. Landlord Issues: - Review your lease agreement carefully - Consider negotiating with your landlord - they might prefer a reliable tenant paying reduced rent than having an empty property - Seek professional advice about your rights under the lease - Consider whether the Commercial Rent (Coronavirus) Act 2022 might still be relevant 3. Financial Review: - Conduct a thorough review of your business finances - Consider consulting an insolvency practitioner for professional advice - Look for ways to reduce costs and increase revenue - Review your pricing strategy 4. Legal Options: - Consider a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) if your business is viable but struggling - This could help restructure debts, including rent - Could potentially force a rent reduction on the landlord - Would need 75% creditor approval 5. Business Debt Advice: - Contact organisations like Business Debtline for free advice - Consider speaking with your local Chamber of Commerce - Consult with an accountant or financial advisor 6. Immediate Actions: - Keep detailed records of all communications with creditors - Continue paying what you can to show good faith - Consider whether restructuring your business model could help - Look into government support schemes if available Consider seeking professional legal and financial advice to explore all options thoroughly.	7.116715669631958	1	"[["" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different rescue options available under the Insolvency Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different restructuring options available under the Companies Act 2006?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the pros and cons of each of these options, and provide advice on the most suitable solution?"", "" Does the lawyer suggest the use of Part 26A restructuring plans?"", "" Does the lawyer speak of the ability of cramming down dissenting creditors in a Part 26A plan, and the conditions for doing it?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3]]"	3	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	22	No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q6	I am a real estate developer. Due to the current housing crisis, my mortgages have ballooned, and I am struggling to make money out of the sale of the properties I recently completed. While my housing portfolio is significant, most properties are not yet ready for the market. I am not paying all my suppliers, and the banks are chasing me multiple times per day. If they foreclose, I lose everything. If I complete all my projects, I can repay the banks and the suppliers. However, one of them just filed a petition for winding up my business. I refuse to believe I am insolvent. Is it likely that the petition will be dismissed?	This is a complex situation that requires careful analysis. Here are key points to consider: 1. Insolvency Test: - Courts typically consider both cash flow insolvency (inability to pay debts as they fall due) and balance sheet insolvency - Currently not paying suppliers and struggling with mortgage payments suggests cash flow insolvency - Having significant assets (property portfolio) doesn't necessarily prevent insolvency determination 2. Challenging Factors: - Multiple creditors pursuing payment - Current inability to pay debts when due - Banks threatening foreclosure - Supplier has taken legal action 3. Potential Defenses: - Future completion value of projects - Overall asset value exceeding liabilities - Temporary cash flow issues versus permanent insolvency However, courts generally focus on current ability to pay debts, not future potential. Without immediate ability to pay creditors, the petition may succeed despite future prospects. Recommendation: 1. Seek immediate legal representation 2. Consider voluntary arrangements with creditors 3. Explore restructuring options 4. Document clear path to solvency The situation appears serious and professional legal advice is crucial.	5.766340494155884	1	"[["" Does the Lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the relevant statutes (ss. 123-124 IA 1986) to determine if a company is insolvent?"", "" Does the law discuss the differences between cash-flow and balance-sheet insolvency?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to s. 122 IA 1986?

Q7	My brother and I have been working together on our hand-made furniture shop for 20+ years. Last year, we had to liquidate the business because we could no longer pay the bills. An official receiver was appointed. Yesterday, he came back to us and asked to repay all the dividends we received in the 5 years before insolvency. This is a ridiculous amount of money (£150,000 each). My brother and I never received a salary. The official receiver says that we could not get any dividends because the business was operating at a loss. We were only paid in dividends to avoid income tax, and because my accountant told me that was fine. Surely, we don’t have to repay that money?	This is a complex situation that unfortunately is quite common. Here's what you need to understand: Key Points: 1. Directors can be required to repay dividends that were unlawfully declared 2. Dividends can only legally be paid from profits, not when the company is operating at a loss 3. Using dividends instead of salary purely for tax purposes doesn't make them legal if there weren't sufficient profits Your position: - The fact that dividends were your only form of income doesn't make them legal - If the company was operating at a loss, these dividends were likely unlawful - The official receiver has the power to demand repayment of unlawful dividends going back several years Recommended actions: 1. Urgently seek professional legal advice, specifically from an insolvency solicitor 2. Gather all financial records and documentation from the past 5 years 3. Review your accountant's advice and documentation 4. Consider whether you have grounds for a professional negligence claim against your accountant You may be able to negotiate a payment plan or settlement with the official receiver, but you'll need professional legal representation to handle this effectively.	7.576098918914795	1	"[["" Does the lawyer discuss their client\u2019s role (de jure, de facto or shadow director) within the company?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss directors\u2019 duties with the client?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the relevant rules applicable to directors (ss. 212-213 IA 1986)?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the consequences (e.g. disqualification) arising from the director\u2019s misfeasance?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the Company Director Disqualification Order Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3]]"	3	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q8	My business went into liquidation last year. I was the owner and director. A liquidator was appointed. He is threatening to sue me for breaching my duties as a director unless I return the money I received as monthly repayments for a loan I gave to my company. He’s also threatening to start a disqualification procedure against me for the same reason. I believe I did nothing wrong – this was a fair loan with interests below the market rate. However, I cannot risk being disqualified, because I am also working as a director in my sister’s company. What can I do? Should I return the money?	"This is a complex situation that requires careful consideration. Here's a breakdown of key points and potential options: Legal Position: - Directors can legally loan money to their companies and receive repayments - However, when a company is insolvent or approaching insolvency, repayments to directors may be challenged as ""preferences"" or breach of director duties Important Considerations: 1. Timing of repayments 2. Company's financial position when repayments were made 3. Documentation of the loan agreement 4. Treatment of other creditors Possible Actions: 1. Seek immediate legal advice from an insolvency specialist 2. Review all documentation related to the loan 3. Consider negotiating with the liquidator 4. Assess whether repaying might be more cost-effective than litigation Regarding disqualification: - Director disqualification can last 2-15 years - Can affect multiple directorships - Legal costs of defending can be significant I recommend: 1. Consult an insolvency lawyer immediately 2. Gather all loan documentation 3. Consider negotiating a settlement if evidence isn't strong 4. Don't ignore the liquidator's demands This is general advice - please seek professional legal counsel for your specific situation."	5.293279409408569	1	"[["" Does the lawyer discuss their client\u2019s role (de jure, de facto or shadow director) within the company?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss directors\u2019 duties with the client?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the relevant rules applicable to directors (ss. 212-213 IA 1986)?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the consequences (e.g. disqualification) arising from the director\u2019s misfeasance?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the Company Director Disqualification Order Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3]]"	11	[0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 3]	25	No|Yes|No|Yes|No|No|Yes|
Q9	My business is operating at a loss. Chase Bank is my major lender, and they have a security over my home. I fell into arrears towards several suppliers, but I do believe I can turn around my business if I am given a bit more time to repay my debts. What can I do?	There are several options you could consider when facing business financial difficulties: 1. Debt Restructuring: - Contact Chase Bank to discuss loan modification or refinancing options - Request an extended repayment period - Negotiate lower interest rates - Consider debt consolidation 2. Negotiate with Suppliers: - Communicate openly about your situation - Propose payment plans - Request extended payment terms - Negotiate partial payments 3. Business Restructuring: - Review and cut unnecessary expenses - Improve cash flow management - Consider selling non-essential assets - Explore new revenue streams 4. Seek Professional Help: - Consult a financial advisor - Work with a business turnaround specialist - Speak with a bankruptcy attorney to understand all options - Consider hiring an accountant for financial planning 5. Legal Protection Options: - Chapter 11 bankruptcy (reorganization) - Chapter 13 bankruptcy (if operating as a sole proprietorship) - Assignment for the benefit of creditors It's advisable to: 1. Act quickly before the situation worsens 2. Keep detailed financial records 3. Maintain open communication with creditors 4. Seek professional advice before making major decisions Consider consulting with a bankruptcy attorney to understand all your options and protect your rights.	6.170250654220581	1	"[["" Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

Q10	My business went into liquidation last March. I tried my best to avoid it. I may have preferred some creditors over others, but simply because they knew I was struggling, and they would not give me their products on credit. I may also have taken some money out of the business account to repay the mortgage on my house. Surely, I did nothing wrong? Do I risk anything?	"This situation raises several legal concerns. Here's why: 1. Preferential Payments: - Paying some creditors over others when a company is insolvent is known as ""preferential treatment"" - This is generally illegal under insolvency law - Liquidators can seek to reverse these payments - Directors can be personally liable for such payments 2. Using Company Funds for Personal Use: - Taking money from the business to pay personal mortgage when company is struggling is potentially wrongful - This could be seen as misappropriation of company assets - Directors have a duty to act in the best interests of all creditors when company is insolvent Potential Risks: - Personal liability for company debts - Disqualification as a director - Legal action by liquidator - In serious cases, criminal charges You should: 1. Seek legal advice immediately 2. Gather all relevant documentation 3. Be honest with the liquidator 4. Consider getting professional advice about your position This is a serious situation requiring professional legal guidance."	6.27388072013855	1	"[["" Does the lawyer mention the directors\u2019 duties under the Companies Act 2006, ss. 250-277?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss the general remedies available against delinquent directors (ss. 212-214 IA 1986)?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss the risks associated with preferential payments to some creditors (s. 239 IA 1986)?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the consequences (e.g. disqualification) arising from the director\u2019s misfeasance?

Q11	My life-long partner just left me for an Italian scugnizzo who is 15 years younger than her. What’s worse is that before leaving, she emptied our joint business account and she stopped paying the joint mortgage we have on our business. The bank is threatening legal actions against me, and to foreclose on the business property. What can I do? By the way, I cannot contact my (ex) partner but I believe she’s now in Italy with her new partner.	This is a serious legal situation that requires immediate action. Here are some steps you should consider taking: 1. Immediately consult with a lawyer who specializes in: - Family law - Business law - International law (given the Italian connection) 2. Document everything: - Gather all financial records - Save any communications with your ex-partner - Document when and how much money was taken - Collect mortgage documents and bank statements 3. Legal actions to consider: - File a police report for theft/fraud - File for an emergency court order to freeze remaining assets - Begin divorce proceedings if married - Consider bankruptcy protection if necessary - File a civil lawsuit against your ex-partner 4. Regarding the mortgage: - Contact the bank to explain the situation - Try to negotiate a temporary payment plan - Consider refinancing options - Document all communications with the bank 5. International considerations: - Your lawyer can advise on international legal options - Consider working with Italian authorities - Look into international asset recovery services 6. Business protection: - Consider restructuring the business - Look into business bankruptcy protection if needed - Explore options to buy out your partner's share Remember to: - Act quickly - Keep detailed records - Don't make any rash decisions without legal counsel - Take care of your mental health during this stressful time	6.529621601104736	1	"[["" Does the Lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the relevant statutes (ss. 123-124 IA 1986) to determine if a company is insolvent?

Q12	After Brexit, I set up a business in the Netherlands. This is a limited liability company. I am the sole director of that company. There are no employees in the Netherlands, just some people I hire occasionally to load and unload the lorries that distribute my products to the rest of Europe. I have now decided to stop selling goods to Europe, because it is not profitable. I want to wind-up the business here in the UK. Can I do it?	"There seems to be a misunderstanding in your question. You mentioned having a company in the Netherlands but then asked about winding up the business ""here in the UK."" These are two different jurisdictions with different legal requirements. For a Dutch limited liability company (B.V. - Besloten Vennootschap): 1. You must follow Dutch law and procedures to dissolve the company 2. The dissolution process must be handled through the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KvK) 3. You may need assistance from a Dutch legal professional or accountant The basic steps for dissolving a Dutch B.V. include: 1. Shareholders' resolution to dissolve 2. Filing dissolution documents with the KvK 3. Settling all debts and obligations 4. Distribution of remaining assets 5. Final tax returns and deregistration You cannot wind up a Dutch company using UK procedures. I would recommend: 1. Consulting a Dutch legal professional 2. Contacting the Dutch Chamber of Commerce 3.
