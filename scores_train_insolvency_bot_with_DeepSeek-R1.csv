Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	"<think> Okay, so the user left their position as a director a couple of months ago after a disagreement. They signed a stock transfer form to return their 5% shares and thought they were removed from the company. Now, the other director sent keys and a note telling them to sell assets, close the business, and pay debts. The user is worried about their responsibilities and potential liabilities. First, I need to check the legal implications of resigning as a director. Under the Companies Act 2006, directors can resign by giving notice. They should have filed a TM01 form with Companies House. If they didn't, they might still be listed as a director, which is a problem because they could be held liable for ongoing company actions. The user needs to confirm if their resignation was properly filed. Next, the stock transfer form. Transferring shares requires approval and updating the register of members. If the transfer wasn't processed, the user might still be a shareholder. But even if they are, as a minority shareholder, their influence is limited. However, being a shareholder doesn't impose the same liabilities as being a director. They should check with Companies House to see if their director status and shareholding are updated. The other director dropping off keys and instructions is concerning. If the user is still a director, they have fiduciary duties. But if they resigned properly, they shouldn't have responsibilities. They need to verify their status. If they're still a director, ignoring the company's issues could lead to personal liability, especially if the company is insolvent. The user's actions: returning keys via recorded delivery is smart to avoid accusations. They shouldn't sell assets or handle company affairs unless they're still a director. If the company is insolvent, directors must act in creditors' interests. The user should check if the company is insolvent using cash flow or balance sheet tests from the Insolvency Act 1986. If insolvent, liquidators might investigate past director actions. The user might need to seek legal advice, especially if there's potential misconduct. The other director's actions could be wrongful trading or misfeasance. The user should document everything and maybe file a report with Companies House if their resignation wasn't processed. Also, if the company can't pay debts, creditors might petition to wind it up under IA 1986 s.124. In summary, key steps: confirm director resignation via TM01 filing, check share transfer status, avoid involvement in company operations, return keys securely, assess insolvency, seek legal advice, and possibly report to Companies House. The user needs to protect themselves from liability by ensuring their resignation is properly recorded and not engaging in company management unless obligated. </think> Based on your description, there are several key legal and procedural issues to address. Below is structured advice based on UK corporate insolvency law, company law, and relevant case law: --- ### **1. Director Resignation & Ongoing Liabilities** - **Resignation Process**: Under the **Companies Act 2006 (s. 154)**, a director can resign by giving notice to the company. However, **resignation is not effective** until a **TM01 form** (Termination of Appointment of Director) is filed with Companies House. If this form has not been filed, you may still be listed as a director on the public register, exposing you to potential liabilities for ongoing company actions. - **Action**: Check the [Companies House register](https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company) to confirm whether your resignation as a director has been recorded. If not, file a **TM01 form** immediately to formalise your resignation. Retain proof of submission. - **Liability for Post-Resignation Actions**: If your resignation was not properly filed, you could be held **jointly liable** for any misconduct, debts, or breaches of duty by the remaining director (e.g., wrongful trading under **Insolvency Act 1986 s. 214**). Even if you resigned, you may still face scrutiny for actions taken while you were a director (e.g., transactions at an undervalue: *Re Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014]*). --- ### **2. Share Transfer & Shareholder Status** - **Stock Transfer Form**: Signing a stock transfer form does not automatically remove you as a shareholder. The company must update its **Register of Members** and file a **confirmation statement** with Companies House. If the shares were not transferred (e.g., no stamp duty paid, no board resolution approving the transfer), you may still legally own the 5% stake. - **Action**: Confirm via the Companies House register whether your shareholding has been removed. If not, seek legal advice to enforce the transfer or challenge the delay. --- ### **3. Handling the Director’s Instructions** - **No Authority to Act**: If you have validly resigned as a director and transferred shares, you **have no legal authority** to manage the company’s assets, sell property, or pay debts. Acting on the director’s instructions could expose you to liability for **misfeasance** (Insolvency Act 1986 s. 212) if the company is insolvent. - **Action**: 1. **Do not engage** in selling assets or paying debts unless you are certain of your resignation status. 2. Return any company property (e.g., keys) via **recorded delivery** (as you planned) to avoid accusations of theft or conversion. --- ### **4. Risk of Insolvency & Personal Liability** - **Insolvency Tests**: If the company cannot pay its debts (cash-flow insolvency: *Re Cheyne Finance [2007]*) or its liabilities exceed assets (balance-sheet insolvency: *BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]*), the directors must act in creditors’ interests. Failure to do so may lead to **wrongful trading** claims. - **Action**: If the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency: - **Do not** attempt to ""close the business"" unilaterally. - Advise the remaining director to seek professional insolvency advice (e.g., appoint administrators or liquidators via **Insolvency Act 1986 Sch. B1**). - If the remaining director is dissipating assets, consider reporting misconduct to the Insolvency Service. --- ### **5. Protecting Yourself** - **Document Everything**: Keep records of your resignation notice, TM01 filing, share transfer form, and correspondence with the other director. These may be critical if disputes arise. - **Legal Advice**: Consult a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to: - Confirm your resignation/shareholder status. - Assess potential liability for unpaid debts or director misconduct. - Apply to court for relief if your resignation is being obstructed (*Re Lancefield [2002]*). --- ### **6. Immediate Next Steps** 1. **Verify Resignation/Shareholding Status** on Companies House. 2. **File TM01** if not already done. 3. **Return Keys** via recorded delivery with a covering letter stating you have no authority to act. 4. **Formally Notify Creditors** (if you are still listed as a director) that you have resigned and are no longer involved. 5. **Seek Legal Advice** to mitigate risks of personal liability. --- ### **Key Statutes & Case Law** - **Companies Act 2006 (s. 154, 167)**: Resignation of directors. - **Insolvency Act 1986 (ss. 123, 124, 212, 214)**: Insolvency tests, wrongful trading, misfeasance. - **Re Cheyne Finance [2007]**: Cash-flow insolvency. - **BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]**: Balance-sheet insolvency. - **Re Casa Estates [2014]**: Transactions at an undervalue. If the company is insolvent, creditors may petition to wind it up under **Insolvency Act 1986 s. 124**, and the court may investigate director conduct under the **Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986**.

Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.

Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	"<think> Okay, so the user left their position as a director a couple of months ago after a disagreement.

Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"<think> Okay, so the user left their position as a director a couple of months ago after a disagreement. They signed a stock transfer form to return their 5% shares and thought they were removed from the company. Now, the other director sent keys and a note telling them to sell assets, close the business, and pay debts. The user is worried about their responsibilities and potential liabilities. First, I need to check the legal implications of resigning as a director. Under the Companies Act 2006, directors can resign by giving notice. They should have filed a TM01 form with Companies House. If they didn't, they might still be listed as a director, which is a problem because they could be held liable for ongoing company actions. The user needs to confirm if their resignation was properly filed. Next, the stock transfer form. Transferring shares requires approval and updating the register of members. If the transfer wasn't processed, the user might still be a shareholder. But even if they are, as a minority shareholder, their influence is limited. However, being a shareholder doesn't impose the same liabilities as being a director. They should check with Companies House to see if their director status and shareholding are updated. The other director dropping off keys and instructions is concerning. If the user is still a director, they have fiduciary duties. But if they resigned properly, they shouldn't have responsibilities. They need to verify their status. If they're still a director, ignoring the company's issues could lead to personal liability, especially if the company is insolvent. The user's actions: returning keys via recorded delivery is smart to avoid accusations. They shouldn't sell assets or handle company affairs unless they're still a director. If the company is insolvent, directors must act in creditors' interests. The user should check if the company is insolvent using cash flow or balance sheet tests from the Insolvency Act 1986. If insolvent, liquidators might investigate past director actions. The user might need to seek legal advice, especially if there's potential misconduct. The other director's actions could be wrongful trading or misfeasance. The user should document everything and maybe file a report with Companies House if their resignation wasn't processed. Also, if the company can't pay debts, creditors might petition to wind it up under IA 1986 s.124. In summary, key steps: confirm director resignation via TM01 filing, check share transfer status, avoid involvement in company operations, return keys securely, assess insolvency, seek legal advice, and possibly report to Companies House. The user needs to protect themselves from liability by ensuring their resignation is properly recorded and not engaging in company management unless obligated. </think> Based on your description, there are several key legal and procedural issues to address. Below is structured advice based on UK corporate insolvency law, company law, and relevant case law: --- ### **1. Director Resignation & Ongoing Liabilities** - **Resignation Process**: Under the **Companies Act 2006 (s. 154)**, a director can resign by giving notice to the company. However, **resignation is not effective** until a **TM01 form** (Termination of Appointment of Director) is filed with Companies House. If this form has not been filed, you may still be listed as a director on the public register, exposing you to potential liabilities for ongoing company actions. - **Action**: Check the [Companies House register](https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company) to confirm whether your resignation as a director has been recorded. If not, file a **TM01 form** immediately to formalise your resignation. Retain proof of submission. - **Liability for Post-Resignation Actions**: If your resignation was not properly filed, you could be held **jointly liable** for any misconduct, debts, or breaches of duty by the remaining director (e.g., wrongful trading under **Insolvency Act 1986 s. 214**). Even if you resigned, you may still face scrutiny for actions taken while you were a director (e.g., transactions at an undervalue: *Re Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014]*). --- ### **2. Share Transfer & Shareholder Status** - **Stock Transfer Form**: Signing a stock transfer form does not automatically remove you as a shareholder. The company must update its **Register of Members** and file a **confirmation statement** with Companies House. If the shares were not transferred (e.g., no stamp duty paid, no board resolution approving the transfer), you may still legally own the 5% stake. - **Action**: Confirm via the Companies House register whether your shareholding has been removed. If not, seek legal advice to enforce the transfer or challenge the delay. --- ### **3. Handling the Director’s Instructions** - **No Authority to Act**: If you have validly resigned as a director and transferred shares, you **have no legal authority** to manage the company’s assets, sell property, or pay debts. Acting on the director’s instructions could expose you to liability for **misfeasance** (Insolvency Act 1986 s. 212) if the company is insolvent. - **Action**: 1. **Do not engage** in selling assets or paying debts unless you are certain of your resignation status. 2. Return any company property (e.g., keys) via **recorded delivery** (as you planned) to avoid accusations of theft or conversion. --- ### **4. Risk of Insolvency & Personal Liability** - **Insolvency Tests**: If the company cannot pay its debts (cash-flow insolvency: *Re Cheyne Finance [2007]*) or its liabilities exceed assets (balance-sheet insolvency: *BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]*), the directors must act in creditors’ interests. Failure to do so may lead to **wrongful trading** claims. - **Action**: If the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency: - **Do not** attempt to ""close the business"" unilaterally. - Advise the remaining director to seek professional insolvency advice (e.g., appoint administrators or liquidators via **Insolvency Act 1986 Sch. B1**). - If the remaining director is dissipating assets, consider reporting misconduct to the Insolvency Service. --- ### **5. Protecting Yourself** - **Document Everything**: Keep records of your resignation notice, TM01 filing, share transfer form, and correspondence with the other director. These may be critical if disputes arise. - **Legal Advice**: Consult a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to: - Confirm your resignation/shareholder status. - Assess potential liability for unpaid debts or director misconduct. - Apply to court for relief if your resignation is being obstructed (*Re Lancefield [2002]*). --- ### **6. Immediate Next Steps** 1. **Verify Resignation/Shareholding Status** on Companies House. 2. **File TM01** if not already done. 3. **Return Keys** via recorded delivery with a covering letter stating you have no authority to act. 4. **Formally Notify Creditors** (if you are still listed as a director) that you have resigned and are no longer involved. 5. **Seek Legal Advice** to mitigate risks of personal liability. --- ### **Key Statutes & Case Law** - **Companies Act 2006 (s. 154, 167)**: Resignation of directors. - **Insolvency Act 1986 (ss. 123, 124, 212, 214)**: Insolvency tests, wrongful trading, misfeasance. - **Re Cheyne Finance [2007]**: Cash-flow insolvency. - **BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]**: Balance-sheet insolvency. - **Re Casa Estates [2014]**: Transactions at an undervalue.

Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	"<think> Okay, so the user left their position as a director a couple of months ago after a disagreement.

Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	"<think> Okay, so the user left their position as a director a couple of months ago after a disagreement. They signed a stock transfer form to return their 5% shares and thought they were removed from the company. Now, the other director sent keys and a note telling them to sell assets, close the business, and pay debts. The user is worried about their responsibilities and potential liabilities. First, I need to check the legal implications of resigning as a director. Under the Companies Act 2006, directors can resign by giving notice. They should have filed a TM01 form with Companies House. If they didn't, they might still be listed as a director, which is a problem because they could be held liable for ongoing company actions. The user needs to confirm if their resignation was properly filed. Next, the stock transfer form. Transferring shares requires approval and updating the register of members. If the transfer wasn't processed, the user might still be a shareholder. But even if they are, as a minority shareholder, their influence is limited. However, being a shareholder doesn't impose the same liabilities as being a director. They should check with Companies House to see if their director status and shareholding are updated. The other director dropping off keys and instructions is concerning. If the user is still a director, they have fiduciary duties. But if they resigned properly, they shouldn't have responsibilities. They need to verify their status. If they're still a director, ignoring the company's issues could lead to personal liability, especially if the company is insolvent. The user's actions: returning keys via recorded delivery is smart to avoid accusations. They shouldn't sell assets or handle company affairs unless they're still a director. If the company is insolvent, directors must act in creditors' interests. The user should check if the company is insolvent using cash flow or balance sheet tests from the Insolvency Act 1986. If insolvent, liquidators might investigate past director actions. The user might need to seek legal advice, especially if there's potential misconduct. The other director's actions could be wrongful trading or misfeasance. The user should document everything and maybe file a report with Companies House if their resignation wasn't processed. Also, if the company can't pay debts, creditors might petition to wind it up under IA 1986 s.124. In summary, key steps: confirm director resignation via TM01 filing, check share transfer status, avoid involvement in company operations, return keys securely, assess insolvency, seek legal advice, and possibly report to Companies House. The user needs to protect themselves from liability by ensuring their resignation is properly recorded and not engaging in company management unless obligated. </think> Based on your description, there are several key legal and procedural issues to address. Below is structured advice based on UK corporate insolvency law, company law, and relevant case law: --- ### **1. Director Resignation & Ongoing Liabilities** - **Resignation Process**: Under the **Companies Act 2006 (s. 154)**, a director can resign by giving notice to the company. However, **resignation is not effective** until a **TM01 form** (Termination of Appointment of Director) is filed with Companies House. If this form has not been filed, you may still be listed as a director on the public register, exposing you to potential liabilities for ongoing company actions. - **Action**: Check the [Companies House register](https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company) to confirm whether your resignation as a director has been recorded. If not, file a **TM01 form** immediately to formalise your resignation. Retain proof of submission. - **Liability for Post-Resignation Actions**: If your resignation was not properly filed, you could be held **jointly liable** for any misconduct, debts, or breaches of duty by the remaining director (e.g., wrongful trading under **Insolvency Act 1986 s. 214**). Even if you resigned, you may still face scrutiny for actions taken while you were a director (e.g., transactions at an undervalue: *Re Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014]*). --- ### **2. Share Transfer & Shareholder Status** - **Stock Transfer Form**: Signing a stock transfer form does not automatically remove you as a shareholder. The company must update its **Register of Members** and file a **confirmation statement** with Companies House. If the shares were not transferred (e.g., no stamp duty paid, no board resolution approving the transfer), you may still legally own the 5% stake. - **Action**: Confirm via the Companies House register whether your shareholding has been removed. If not, seek legal advice to enforce the transfer or challenge the delay. --- ### **3. Handling the Director’s Instructions** - **No Authority to Act**: If you have validly resigned as a director and transferred shares, you **have no legal authority** to manage the company’s assets, sell property, or pay debts. Acting on the director’s instructions could expose you to liability for **misfeasance** (Insolvency Act 1986 s. 212) if the company is insolvent. - **Action**: 1. **Do not engage** in selling assets or paying debts unless you are certain of your resignation status. 2. Return any company property (e.g., keys) via **recorded delivery** (as you planned) to avoid accusations of theft or conversion. --- ### **4. Risk of Insolvency & Personal Liability** - **Insolvency Tests**: If the company cannot pay its debts (cash-flow insolvency: *Re Cheyne Finance [2007]*) or its liabilities exceed assets (balance-sheet insolvency: *BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]*), the directors must act in creditors’ interests. Failure to do so may lead to **wrongful trading** claims. - **Action**: If the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency: - **Do not** attempt to ""close the business"" unilaterally. - Advise the remaining director to seek professional insolvency advice (e.g., appoint administrators or liquidators via **Insolvency Act 1986 Sch. B1**). - If the remaining director is dissipating assets, consider reporting misconduct to the Insolvency Service. --- ### **5. Protecting Yourself** - **Document Everything**: Keep records of your resignation notice, TM01 filing, share transfer form, and correspondence with the other director. These may be critical if disputes arise. - **Legal Advice**: Consult a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to: - Confirm your resignation/shareholder status. - Assess potential liability for unpaid debts or director misconduct. - Apply to court for relief if your resignation is being obstructed (*Re Lancefield [2002]*). --- ### **6.

Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?

Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise.

Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	"<think> Okay, so the user left their position as a director a couple of months ago after a disagreement. They signed a stock transfer form to return their 5% shares and thought they were removed from the company. Now, the other director sent keys and a note telling them to sell assets, close the business, and pay debts. The user is worried about their responsibilities and potential liabilities. First, I need to check the legal implications of resigning as a director. Under the Companies Act 2006, directors can resign by giving notice. They should have filed a TM01 form with Companies House. If they didn't, they might still be listed as a director, which is a problem because they could be held liable for ongoing company actions. The user needs to confirm if their resignation was properly filed. Next, the stock transfer form. Transferring shares requires approval and updating the register of members. If the transfer wasn't processed, the user might still be a shareholder. But even if they are, as a minority shareholder, their influence is limited. However, being a shareholder doesn't impose the same liabilities as being a director. They should check with Companies House to see if their director status and shareholding are updated. The other director dropping off keys and instructions is concerning. If the user is still a director, they have fiduciary duties. But if they resigned properly, they shouldn't have responsibilities. They need to verify their status. If they're still a director, ignoring the company's issues could lead to personal liability, especially if the company is insolvent. The user's actions: returning keys via recorded delivery is smart to avoid accusations. They shouldn't sell assets or handle company affairs unless they're still a director. If the company is insolvent, directors must act in creditors' interests. The user should check if the company is insolvent using cash flow or balance sheet tests from the Insolvency Act 1986. If insolvent, liquidators might investigate past director actions. The user might need to seek legal advice, especially if there's potential misconduct. The other director's actions could be wrongful trading or misfeasance. The user should document everything and maybe file a report with Companies House if their resignation wasn't processed. Also, if the company can't pay debts, creditors might petition to wind it up under IA 1986 s.124. In summary, key steps: confirm director resignation via TM01 filing, check share transfer status, avoid involvement in company operations, return keys securely, assess insolvency, seek legal advice, and possibly report to Companies House. The user needs to protect themselves from liability by ensuring their resignation is properly recorded and not engaging in company management unless obligated. </think> Based on your description, there are several key legal and procedural issues to address. Below is structured advice based on UK corporate insolvency law, company law, and relevant case law: --- ### **1. Director Resignation & Ongoing Liabilities** - **Resignation Process**: Under the **Companies Act 2006 (s. 154)**, a director can resign by giving notice to the company. However, **resignation is not effective** until a **TM01 form** (Termination of Appointment of Director) is filed with Companies House. If this form has not been filed, you may still be listed as a director on the public register, exposing you to potential liabilities for ongoing company actions. - **Action**: Check the [Companies House register](https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company) to confirm whether your resignation as a director has been recorded. If not, file a **TM01 form** immediately to formalise your resignation. Retain proof of submission. - **Liability for Post-Resignation Actions**: If your resignation was not properly filed, you could be held **jointly liable** for any misconduct, debts, or breaches of duty by the remaining director (e.g., wrongful trading under **Insolvency Act 1986 s. 214**). Even if you resigned, you may still face scrutiny for actions taken while you were a director (e.g., transactions at an undervalue: *Re Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014]*). --- ### **2. Share Transfer & Shareholder Status** - **Stock Transfer Form**: Signing a stock transfer form does not automatically remove you as a shareholder. The company must update its **Register of Members** and file a **confirmation statement** with Companies House. If the shares were not transferred (e.g., no stamp duty paid, no board resolution approving the transfer), you may still legally own the 5% stake. - **Action**: Confirm via the Companies House register whether your shareholding has been removed. If not, seek legal advice to enforce the transfer or challenge the delay. --- ### **3. Handling the Director’s Instructions** - **No Authority to Act**: If you have validly resigned as a director and transferred shares, you **have no legal authority** to manage the company’s assets, sell property, or pay debts. Acting on the director’s instructions could expose you to liability for **misfeasance** (Insolvency Act 1986 s. 212) if the company is insolvent. - **Action**: 1. **Do not engage** in selling assets or paying debts unless you are certain of your resignation status. 2. Return any company property (e.g., keys) via **recorded delivery** (as you planned) to avoid accusations of theft or conversion. --- ### **4. Risk of Insolvency & Personal Liability** - **Insolvency Tests**: If the company cannot pay its debts (cash-flow insolvency: *Re Cheyne Finance [2007]*) or its liabilities exceed assets (balance-sheet insolvency: *BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]*), the directors must act in creditors’ interests. Failure to do so may lead to **wrongful trading** claims. - **Action**: If the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency: - **Do not** attempt to ""close the business"" unilaterally. - Advise the remaining director to seek professional insolvency advice (e.g., appoint administrators or liquidators via **Insolvency Act 1986 Sch. B1**). - If the remaining director is dissipating assets, consider reporting misconduct to the Insolvency Service. --- ### **5. Protecting Yourself** - **Document Everything**: Keep records of your resignation notice, TM01 filing, share transfer form, and correspondence with the other director. These may be critical if disputes arise. - **Legal Advice**: Consult a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to: - Confirm your resignation/shareholder status. - Assess potential liability for unpaid debts or director misconduct. - Apply to court for relief if your resignation is being obstructed (*Re Lancefield [2002]*). --- ### **6.

Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?

Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?

Return any company property (e.g., keys) via **recorded delivery** (as you planned) to avoid accusations of theft or conversion. --- ### **4. Risk of Insolvency & Personal Liability** - **Insolvency Tests**: If the company cannot pay its debts (cash-flow insolvency: *Re Cheyne Finance [2007]*) or its liabilities exceed assets (balance-sheet insolvency: *BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]*), the directors must act in creditors’ interests. Failure to do so may lead to **wrongful trading** claims. - **Action**: If the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency: - **Do not** attempt to ""close the business"" unilaterally. - Advise the remaining director to seek professional insolvency advice (e.g., appoint administrators or liquidators via **Insolvency Act 1986 Sch. B1**). - If the remaining director is dissipating assets, consider reporting misconduct to the Insolvency Service. --- ### **5. Protecting Yourself** - **Document Everything**: Keep records of your resignation notice, TM01 filing, share transfer form, and correspondence with the other director. These may be critical if disputes arise. - **Legal Advice**: Consult a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to: - Confirm your resignation/shareholder status. - Assess potential liability for unpaid debts or director misconduct. - Apply to court for relief if your resignation is being obstructed (*Re Lancefield [2002]*). --- ### **6. Immediate Next Steps** 1. **Verify Resignation/Shareholding Status** on Companies House. 2. **File TM01** if not already done. 3. **Return Keys** via recorded delivery with a covering letter stating you have no authority to act. 4. **Formally Notify Creditors** (if you are still listed as a director) that you have resigned and are no longer involved. 5. **Seek Legal Advice** to mitigate risks of personal liability. --- ### **Key Statutes & Case Law** - **Companies Act 2006 (s. 154, 167)**: Resignation of directors. - **Insolvency Act 1986 (ss. 123, 124, 212, 214)**: Insolvency tests, wrongful trading, misfeasance. - **Re Cheyne Finance [2007]**: Cash-flow insolvency. - **BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]**: Balance-sheet insolvency. - **Re Casa Estates [2014]**: Transactions at an undervalue. If the company is insolvent, creditors may petition to wind it up under **Insolvency Act 1986 s. 124**, and the court may investigate director conduct under the **Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986**.

Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	"<think> Okay, so the user left their position as a director a couple of months ago after a disagreement. They signed a stock transfer form to return their 5% shares and thought they were removed from the company. Now, the other director sent keys and a note telling them to sell assets, close the business, and pay debts. The user is worried about their responsibilities and potential liabilities. First, I need to check the legal implications of resigning as a director. Under the Companies Act 2006, directors can resign by giving notice. They should have filed a TM01 form with Companies House. If they didn't, they might still be listed as a director, which is a problem because they could be held liable for ongoing company actions. The user needs to confirm if their resignation was properly filed. Next, the stock transfer form. Transferring shares requires approval and updating the register of members. If the transfer wasn't processed, the user might still be a shareholder. But even if they are, as a minority shareholder, their influence is limited. However, being a shareholder doesn't impose the same liabilities as being a director. They should check with Companies House to see if their director status and shareholding are updated. The other director dropping off keys and instructions is concerning. If the user is still a director, they have fiduciary duties. But if they resigned properly, they shouldn't have responsibilities. They need to verify their status. If they're still a director, ignoring the company's issues could lead to personal liability, especially if the company is insolvent. The user's actions: returning keys via recorded delivery is smart to avoid accusations. They shouldn't sell assets or handle company affairs unless they're still a director. If the company is insolvent, directors must act in creditors' interests. The user should check if the company is insolvent using cash flow or balance sheet tests from the Insolvency Act 1986. If insolvent, liquidators might investigate past director actions. The user might need to seek legal advice, especially if there's potential misconduct. The other director's actions could be wrongful trading or misfeasance. The user should document everything and maybe file a report with Companies House if their resignation wasn't processed. Also, if the company can't pay debts, creditors might petition to wind it up under IA 1986 s.124. In summary, key steps: confirm director resignation via TM01 filing, check share transfer status, avoid involvement in company operations, return keys securely, assess insolvency, seek legal advice, and possibly report to Companies House. The user needs to protect themselves from liability by ensuring their resignation is properly recorded and not engaging in company management unless obligated. </think> Based on your description, there are several key legal and procedural issues to address. Below is structured advice based on UK corporate insolvency law, company law, and relevant case law: --- ### **1. Director Resignation & Ongoing Liabilities** - **Resignation Process**: Under the **Companies Act 2006 (s. 154)**, a director can resign by giving notice to the company. However, **resignation is not effective** until a **TM01 form** (Termination of Appointment of Director) is filed with Companies House. If this form has not been filed, you may still be listed as a director on the public register, exposing you to potential liabilities for ongoing company actions. - **Action**: Check the [Companies House register](https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company) to confirm whether your resignation as a director has been recorded. If not, file a **TM01 form** immediately to formalise your resignation. Retain proof of submission. - **Liability for Post-Resignation Actions**: If your resignation was not properly filed, you could be held **jointly liable** for any misconduct, debts, or breaches of duty by the remaining director (e.g., wrongful trading under **Insolvency Act 1986 s. 214**). Even if you resigned, you may still face scrutiny for actions taken while you were a director (e.g., transactions at an undervalue: *Re Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014]*). --- ### **2. Share Transfer & Shareholder Status** - **Stock Transfer Form**: Signing a stock transfer form does not automatically remove you as a shareholder. The company must update its **Register of Members** and file a **confirmation statement** with Companies House. If the shares were not transferred (e.g., no stamp duty paid, no board resolution approving the transfer), you may still legally own the 5% stake. - **Action**: Confirm via the Companies House register whether your shareholding has been removed. If not, seek legal advice to enforce the transfer or challenge the delay. --- ### **3. Handling the Director’s Instructions** - **No Authority to Act**: If you have validly resigned as a director and transferred shares, you **have no legal authority** to manage the company’s assets, sell property, or pay debts. Acting on the director’s instructions could expose you to liability for **misfeasance** (Insolvency Act 1986 s. 212) if the company is insolvent. - **Action**: 1. **Do not engage** in selling assets or paying debts unless you are certain of your resignation status. 2. Return any company property (e.g., keys) via **recorded delivery** (as you planned) to avoid accusations of theft or conversion. --- ### **4. Risk of Insolvency & Personal Liability** - **Insolvency Tests**: If the company cannot pay its debts (cash-flow insolvency: *Re Cheyne Finance [2007]*) or its liabilities exceed assets (balance-sheet insolvency: *BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]*), the directors must act in creditors’ interests. Failure to do so may lead to **wrongful trading** claims. - **Action**: If the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency: - **Do not** attempt to ""close the business"" unilaterally. - Advise the remaining director to seek professional insolvency advice (e.g., appoint administrators or liquidators via **Insolvency Act 1986 Sch. B1**). - If the remaining director is dissipating assets, consider reporting misconduct to the Insolvency Service. --- ### **5. Protecting Yourself** - **Document Everything**: Keep records of your resignation notice, TM01 filing, share transfer form, and correspondence with the other director. These may be critical if disputes arise. - **Legal Advice**: Consult a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to: - Confirm your resignation/shareholder status. - Assess potential liability for unpaid debts or director misconduct. - Apply to court for relief if your resignation is being obstructed (*Re Lancefield [2002]*). --- ### **6. Immediate Next Steps** 1. **Verify Resignation/Shareholding Status** on Companies House. 2. **File TM01** if not already done. 3. **Return Keys** via recorded delivery with a covering letter stating you have no authority to act. 4. **Formally Notify Creditors** (if you are still listed as a director) that you have resigned and are no longer involved. 5. **Seek Legal Advice** to mitigate risks of personal liability. --- ### **Key Statutes & Case Law** - **Companies Act 2006 (s. 154, 167)**: Resignation of directors. - **Insolvency Act 1986 (ss. 123, 124, 212, 214)**: Insolvency tests, wrongful trading, misfeasance. - **Re Cheyne Finance [2007]**: Cash-flow insolvency. - **BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail [2013]**: Balance-sheet insolvency. - **Re Casa Estates [2014]**: Transactions at an undervalue. If the company is insolvent, creditors may petition to wind it up under **Insolvency Act 1986 s. 124**, and the court may investigate director conduct under the **Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986**.

Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	"<think> Okay, the user is winding up their limited company, which has just them and their wife as directors. No employees, which simplifies things a bit. They stopped trading on December 24th but moved out of premises on January 18th. The landlord was okay with not paying rent and agreed to them leaving quickly. Their debts include directors' loans (a couple of thousand), and current direct debits for energy, water, and broadband. The energy bill is due this quarter and is the biggest. They have £600 left in the business account. They want to know who to prioritize and what happens when creditors chase the remaining debts. First, I need to recall the order of priority in insolvency. Secured creditors first, then preferential, then unsecured. But since this is a voluntary winding up, maybe a members' voluntary liquidation (MVL) if solvent, or creditors' voluntary liquidation (CVL) if insolvent. The user hasn't mentioned insolvency, but with debts and only £600 left, maybe they're insolvent. Directors' loans are typically unsecured, so they'd rank after preferential creditors. But if the company is solvent, directors can repay themselves. But here, the company might not have enough assets. Energy, water, and broadband are utility providers, unsecured creditors. Landlord's rent – if they haven't paid, that's another unsecured debt. But the landlord agreed to let them leave without paying, so maybe that debt isn't being pursued? Need to check if the landlord has a claim. Prioritizing payments: If the company is insolvent, the user has to follow statutory order. But since they're still in control (not in liquidation yet), they might be tempted to pay certain creditors, but that could be a preference. Under the Insolvency Act, preferential creditors include employee wages, but there are no employees here. Next are certain taxes, but if there's no VAT or PAYE, that's not an issue. Then unsecured creditors. Directors' loans are unsecured, so they come after. But if the company pays one unsecured creditor over another, that could be a preference if done within two years before insolvency. So the user needs to be careful. Maybe the best approach is to not pay any creditors and let the liquidation process handle it. But since they have £600, they might need to distribute it correctly. If they proceed with a CVL, the liquidator will handle the assets and distribute according to the hierarchy. Directors' loans would be treated as unsecured, so they might not get repaid. If the company is dissolved, any remaining debts are written off, except if the directors gave personal guarantees. But the user mentioned directors' loans. If the company owes them money, they would be creditors. However, in insolvency, they can't prioritize their own loans. They have to wait along with other unsecured creditors. The energy company might chase the debt, but once the company is dissolved, the debt is extinguished. However, if the energy contract was signed personally, but in a limited company, usually the liability is on the company. Wait, but the user might have signed personal guarantees for utilities. If not, then the debt is the company's. If the company is dissolved, the creditors can't pursue the directors personally unless there's a guarantee. So the steps are: Determine if solvent or insolvent. If insolvent, follow CVL. Use the £600 to pay liquidation fees or necessary costs. If there are no assets, the creditors won't get paid. Once dissolved, debts are written off. But the user might not know if they're solvent. Solvent means assets exceed liabilities. They have £600, and debts are directors' loans (which are liabilities owed to directors) plus utilities. If the total debts (including utilities) are more than £600, then insolvent. In that case, the right process is CVL. They need to appoint a liquidator. The liquidator will realize assets, pay fees first, then preferential creditors (none here), then unsecured. The £600 might cover part of the liquidation costs. Alternatively, if they can strike off the company using DS01 form, but only if they haven't traded in 3 months, settled all debts, and not in any insolvency proceedings. Since they have recent debts, they might not be eligible. Applying for strike-off could lead to creditors objecting. If they proceed with strike-off, they must use the £600 to pay creditors as much as possible. But since they can't pay all, they should distribute the funds proportionally. However, if they don't, and the company is struck off, the creditors can apply to restore the company, but that's rare for small amounts. But the user must ensure they follow the right steps to avoid wrongful trading or personal liability. Since they stopped trading in December, they should have ceased incurring new debts. Moving out in January might have incurred some costs. Key points: Do not prefer any creditor; if insolvent, follow proper liquidation. If solvent, repay debts and distribute remaining assets. Directors' loans are assets if the company owes the directors, but if the directors owe the company, that's different. Wait, the user says ""directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand"". Typically, directors' loans are money the directors have lent to the company. So if the company owes the directors money, those are liabilities. In liquidation, the directors as creditors would rank equally with other unsecured creditors. But in practice, directors might choose not to claim their loans to allow other creditors to be paid, but legally, they have to be treated equally. So the £600 should be used to pay the costs of liquidation first, then if anything left, to unsecured creditors proportionally. If they proceed with strike-off, they need to pay debts as far as possible. If they can't, they should inform creditors and apply for strike-off, but creditors might object. When the company is dissolved, remaining debts are written off, but if the directors acted improperly (e.g., wrongful trading), they could be personally liable. Since the debts are small and they agreed with the landlord, maybe low risk. So the advice: Check solvency. If insolvent, consider CVL or striking off. Use remaining funds to pay liquidation costs or distribute to creditors proportionally. Creditors can chase, but after dissolution, they can't. Make sure no personal guarantees are in place. File necessary forms with Companies House. </think> When winding up your limited company, it’s crucial to prioritise creditors correctly and follow statutory procedures to avoid personal liability. Here’s a structured approach based on your situation: --- ### **1. Determine Solvency** - **Key Question**: Are the company’s assets (including the £600) sufficient to pay all debts (utilities, directors’ loans, etc.)? - If **yes** (solvent): Proceed with a **Members’ Voluntary Liquidation (MVL)**. - If **no** (insolvent): Use a **Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation (CVL)** or apply for **striking off** (if eligible). Given the limited funds and outstanding utility bills, insolvency is likely. Proceed cautiously. --- ### **2. Priority of Payments (Insolvency Hierarchy)** Under the **Insolvency Act 1986**, creditors are paid in this order: 1. **Liquidation costs** (e.g., liquidator fees). 2. **Preferential creditors**: None here (no employees or unpaid taxes). 3. **Unsecured creditors**: - Utility providers (energy, water, broadband). - Directors’ loans (treated as unsecured debts). 4. **Shareholders**: Residual funds (rare in insolvency). **Your £600**: Use it to cover liquidation costs first. If insufficient, the liquidator will manage distributions. --- ### **3. Key Risks and Steps** #### (a) **Avoid Preferential Payments** - Do **not** prioritise repaying directors’ loans or one utility over others. This could be deemed a **“preference”** under [Insolvency Act 1986, s.239](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/45/section/239), risking personal liability. #### (b) **Formal Liquidation (CVL) vs. Strike-Off** - **CVL**: - Appoint a licensed insolvency practitioner. - Ensures statutory compliance; creditors cannot later claim wrongful trading. - Costs ~£3,000–£5,000 (but your £600 would contribute). - **Strike-Off (Form DS01)**: - **Only if**: - No trading/liabilities for 3 months (questionable here, as utilities are recent). - Creditors are notified and do not object. - **Risk**: Creditors (e.g., energy company) could object or later apply to restore the company. #### (c) **Directors’ Loans** - If the company owes you money, these rank **equally with other unsecured creditors**. You cannot reclaim them ahead of utilities. - If **you owe the company money**, this must be repaid before dissolution (but unlikely given your description). --- ### **4. What Happens if Creditors Chase Debts?** - **During Liquidation**: The liquidator handles creditor claims. - **After Dissolution**:"	303.2774467468262	2	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.
