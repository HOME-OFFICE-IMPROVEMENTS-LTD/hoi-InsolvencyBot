Q1	I have been the director of three companies over the last few years: Motor Racing Limited, Car Racing Limited, and Classic Racing Limited. The first two have gone into liquidation six months ago. Am I allowed to continue trading with the third company?	Based on the information provided, it is important to consider the implications of the Companies Act 2006 and the Insolvency Act 1986. Under the Companies Act 2006, an individual can be disqualified from acting as a company director if they have been involved in the management of a company that has gone into insolvent liquidation. This disqualification can last for a period of up to 15 years. Additionally, the Insolvency Act 1986 imposes restrictions on individuals who have been directors of companies that have entered liquidation. Section 22.5 of the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 prohibits individuals from acting as a director of another company with a name that is the same or similar to a company in insolvent liquidation within the previous 12 months. As Motor Racing Limited and Car Racing Limited have gone into liquidation, it is necessary to consider whether you have been disqualified or restricted from acting as a director. If you have not been disqualified or restricted, you may be able to continue trading with Classic Racing Limited. However, it is important to seek legal advice to confirm your position and to ensure compliance with all legal requirements. It is recommended to consult with a corporate insolvency lawyer who can review the specific details of your situation and provide tailored legal advice. They can assess any potential risks and obligations you may have as a director and guide you on the best course of action.
