Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	"This is a messy situation, and you're right to be concerned and to want to protect yourself. Here's a breakdown of the issues, what you *shouldn't* do, what you *should* do, and why, along with some critical considerations: **Key Issues and Why This is Serious** * **Directorship Responsibilities (Even if You Thought You Resigned):** Even if you *intended* to resign, and even if you signed a stock transfer form, your *legal* status as a director (and your responsibilities) depend on whether the correct filings were made with the relevant company registry (e.g., Companies House in the UK, the Secretary of State in the US, etc.). If the other director didn't file the necessary paperwork (TM01 form in the UK to terminate a directorship), you are *still legally a director*. This is the core problem. Being a director carries significant legal responsibilities, including: * **Duty of Care:** You have a duty to act in the best interests of the company. * **Fiduciary Duty:** You must act honestly and avoid conflicts of interest. * **Liability for Debts:** In certain circumstances (especially if the company becomes insolvent), directors can be held *personally* liable for company debts. This is the biggest risk for you. * **Winding Up:** If the company is to be closed down, directors are responsible for doing so properly, including paying off creditors. * **Stock Ownership vs. Directorship:** These are two separate things. Transferring your shares (the 5%) removes your *ownership* stake, but it *doesn't automatically* remove you as a director. You can be a director without owning shares, and you can own shares without being a director. * **The Other Director's Actions:** The other director's actions are highly questionable and potentially illegal. Essentially, they've abandoned their responsibilities and dumped them on you. This could be considered a breach of their own directorial duties. The instruction to ""send the other director some money"" is particularly concerning and should be treated with extreme caution. * **Company Assets and Debts:** You need to know the financial state of the company. Are there significant assets? Are there significant debts? The answers to these questions will dramatically affect your next steps. * **Office Keys and ""Abandonment"":** The other director essentially abandoning the business premises and assets is a red flag. It suggests they may be trying to avoid responsibility. **What You Should *NOT* Do** * **Do NOT take possession of the keys for long:** You are right to be concerned about being accused of theft, send them back to the registered address with recorded post. * **Do NOT attempt to sell assets or pay off debts on your own:** You don't have clear legal authority to do this, and you could expose yourself to further liability. You also don't know the full financial picture. * **Do NOT send the other director any money:** This is highly suspicious and could be seen as an admission of liability. * **Do NOT ignore the situation:** Hoping it will go away will only make things worse. The legal responsibilities of a director don't disappear just because you want them to. * **Do NOT sign any further documents** Until you understand your legal position and take professional advice. **What You *SHOULD* Do (Immediately)** 1. **Gather Information:** * **Company Registry Check:** The *absolute first step* is to check the official company registry (Companies House in the UK, your state's Secretary of State in the US) to see if you are *still listed as a director*. This is public information. This will confirm your legal status. * **Company Documents:** Try to locate any company documents you have, including the company's incorporation documents, shareholder agreements, minutes of meetings, and any financial records. * **Stock Transfer Form:** Keep a copy of the stock transfer form you signed. * **The Note:** Keep the note from the other director, and a record of receiving the office keys. 2. **Seek Legal Advice (URGENTLY):** You need to speak to a solicitor/lawyer who specializes in company law *immediately*. Explain the entire situation, providing them with all the information you've gathered. They will be able to: * Advise you on your legal position (whether you are still a director). * Explain your potential liabilities. * Advise you on the best course of action to protect yourself. * Help you communicate with the other director (or their legal representative). * Advise you on the proper procedure for winding up the company, if necessary. 3. **Consider an Accountant/Insolvency Practitioner:** If the company has significant debts, you may also need to speak to an accountant or, if the company is insolvent (unable to pay its debts), an insolvency practitioner. They can advise you on the financial aspects of the situation and the proper procedures for dealing with creditors. 4. **Formal Resignation (If Necessary):** If the company registry check confirms you are still a director, your lawyer will likely advise you to formally resign *immediately* by following the correct legal procedure (filing the TM01 form in the UK, or the equivalent in your jurisdiction). Even if your resignation is backdated, it's crucial to have the official record. 5. **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of all communications, actions taken, and advice received. This will be essential if there are any legal disputes later. 6. **Return the Keys:** Send the keys back to the registered company address (not the other directors personal address) by recorded delivery, with a covering letter. State in the letter that you do not accept the keys, nor the instruction, and that you are taking legal advice. Keep a copy of the letter and proof of postage. **Possible Outcomes and Considerations** * **Negotiation:** Your lawyer might be able to negotiate with the other director (or their lawyer) to resolve the situation amicably, perhaps by agreeing on a formal winding-up process. * **Legal Action:** You may need to take legal action against the other director for breach of their directorial duties. Conversely, the other director *could* try to take action against you, so be prepared. * **Insolvency:** If the company is insolvent, the situation becomes more complex. An insolvency practitioner will need to be appointed to manage the process of winding up the company and dealing with creditors. Your personal liability will depend on the specific circumstances and the advice of your lawyer. * **Backdated Resignation:** It *might* be possible to argue that your resignation should be backdated to the time you signed the stock transfer form, but this is not guaranteed and will depend on the specific facts and the applicable laws. Your lawyer will advise you on this. **In summary, this is a serious situation that requires immediate legal advice. Do not attempt to handle this on your own. Your priority is to protect yourself from potential liability and to ensure that any actions taken are legally sound.** "	21.91402220726013	1	"[[""Does the lawyer mention the key features of a director?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to sections 154-155 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer identify the criteria for being a director under the law?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to sections 250-251 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to the circumstances in which a director can be removed from their position?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to s.168 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law when advice is provided?"", ""Does the lawyer ask which form was signed?

Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	"This is a truly awful situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling angry, stressed, and desperate. It's also incredibly unfair that your partner's hard work isn't being compensated, especially with such a large family to support. Here's a breakdown of your options, addressing each of your questions and providing some actionable steps: **Understanding the Chain of Subcontracting and Liability** The key issue here is the chain of contracts: * **Your Partner <-> X:** Your partner has a direct contractual relationship (even if it's not a formal written contract, a verbal agreement for work and payment is still a contract) with X. X is *primarily* responsible for paying your partner. * **X <-> Y:** X has a contract with Y. Y is responsible for paying X *according to the terms of their agreement*. * **Y <-> Big House Builder:** Y has a contract with the large house builder. The problem is that liability doesn't typically ""flow up"" the chain easily. The big house builder has no direct contractual obligation to your partner, and neither does Y. Their responsibility is to the party they directly contracted with. However, there are *some* circumstances where you might have leverage, and we'll explore those. **Your Options and Actions** 1. **Focus on X (Immediate Action Required):** * **Formal Demand Letter:** Send X a formal ""Letter Before Action"" (also sometimes called a ""Demand Letter""). This is a crucial step. You can find templates online (search for ""letter before action template UK unpaid wages""). The letter should: * State the amount owed (£1800 after tax). * Specify the dates the work was performed. * Give X a specific deadline (e.g., 7 days) to pay. * State that if payment isn't received by the deadline, you will take legal action. * Send this by *recorded delivery* so you have proof it was received. Keep a copy. * **Small Claims Court:** If X doesn't respond to the demand letter, your most likely route is the Small Claims Court. This is designed for straightforward claims (under £10,000 in England and Wales). You can start the process online through Money Claim Online (MCOL): [https://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/](https://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/). There are fees involved, but these can be added to the claim. * **ACAS Early Conciliation:** Before starting a claim for unpaid wages (which is a type of breach of contract), you *must* notify ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service). They offer a free ""Early Conciliation"" service to try and resolve the dispute without going to court. This is a legal requirement. You can start this process online: [https://www.acas.org.uk/early-conciliation](https://www.acas.org.uk/early-conciliation). ACAS will contact X and try to mediate. * **Gather Evidence:** Collect *everything* related to the work: * Timesheets (if any). * Texts/emails with X about the work and payment. * Bank statements showing previous payments from X (if any). * Any witnesses who can confirm your partner did the work. * Details of the sites where the work was done. 2. **Exploring Options with Y and the Big House Builder (Limited Leverage):** * **Contacting Y:** It's worth contacting Y, explaining the situation, and asking if they can intervene. While they're not *legally* obligated to pay your partner, they might be willing to put pressure on X, especially if X owes them £30,000. Be polite but firm, and emphasize the hardship this is causing your family. Focus on the fact that X is not fulfilling their obligations, which reflects poorly on Y's choice of subcontractor. * **Contacting the Big House Builder:** This is a longer shot, but *might* be worth it, particularly if it's a large, reputable company with a strong emphasis on ethical practices and supply chain responsibility. *Don't* threaten them. Instead: * Explain the situation calmly and factually. * Highlight that a subcontractor (X) working indirectly for them has not paid their workers. * Emphasize the reputational risk to the house builder. They might not want to be associated with a company that doesn't pay its workers. * Ask if they have any mechanisms for ensuring fair payment practices within their supply chain. Some large companies *do* have clauses in their contracts that require subcontractors to pay their workers properly. * Find the right person to contact. Don't just call the general customer service line. Look for someone in procurement, supply chain management, or even corporate social responsibility. LinkedIn can be helpful for this. * **""Construction Act"" Considerations (Important):** The Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 (often called the ""Construction Act"") applies to most construction contracts in the UK. It includes provisions for payment and dispute resolution. *Crucially*, it has rules about ""payment notices"" and the right to suspend work for non-payment. While your partner's contract is with X, the principles of the Construction Act *might* offer some indirect leverage. Specifically, if Y didn't issue proper payment notices to X, that could be a breach of *their* contract, and you might be able to use that to pressure Y. This is a complex area, and you'd need advice from a construction lawyer to fully explore it, but it's worth mentioning. * **Naming and shaming:** Only do this as a very last resort. 3. **Additional Support and Advice:** * **Citizens Advice:** Continue to pursue help from Citizens Advice, even with the delay. They can provide free, impartial advice on your rights and options. * **Trade Unions:** If your partner is a member of a relevant trade union (e.g., Unite, GMB), contact them. They may be able to offer legal assistance and support. * **Legal Aid:** Check if you're eligible for legal aid. This could help cover the costs of legal advice and representation. * **Local Law Centres:** Some areas have law centres that offer free or low-cost legal advice. * **Debt Advice:** Given your current financial situation, seek advice from a debt charity like StepChange or National Debtline. They can help you manage your debts and explore options like budgeting and debt relief. **Key Points and Cautions** * **Prioritize X:** Your strongest legal claim is against X. Focus your initial efforts there. * **Document Everything:** Keep meticulous records of all communications, actions, and expenses. * **Act Quickly:** There are time limits for making claims, so don't delay. * **Don't Give Up:** This is a difficult situation, but you have rights. Persistence is key. * **Be Realistic:** While you might be able to put pressure on Y and the big house builder, their legal obligation is limited. * **Consider other jobs:** While this is being dealt with, it would be sensible for your partner to look for other work to generate income. This is a complex situation involving multiple parties and contractual relationships. While I've outlined the most likely avenues, getting specific legal advice tailored to your partner's exact circumstances is highly recommended, especially if you encounter resistance from X or want to explore the more complex aspects of the Construction Act.

Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	"Good Evening. I understand you're in an incredibly stressful and overwhelming situation. It sounds absolutely devastating, and it's completely natural to feel like you've lost everything and to question whether it's worth continuing. *Please know that there are people who can help, and there are almost always options, even in the most difficult circumstances.* It's crucial to get the right advice and support *immediately*. You are right to seek a specialist lawyer, and I'll outline what kind of lawyer you need and what they can do, along with some crucial steps you should take. **First, and most importantly: You are not alone, and it's vital to seek support for your mental health.** The stress you're describing can be incredibly damaging. Please consider reaching out to: * **Samaritans (UK):** Call 116 123 (free, 24/7). They provide confidential emotional support. * **Mind (UK):** Call 0300 123 3393 (info line, weekdays 9 am - 6 pm). They offer information and support on mental health. * **Your GP:** Talk to your doctor. They can refer you to mental health services. * **Business Debtline** 0800 197 6026 **Legal and Financial Steps (Immediate Action Required)** 1. **The Right Lawyer:** You need a solicitor who specializes in **both insolvency law and commercial property law**. This is a complex situation involving multiple legal areas: * **Insolvency:** Dealing with the liquidation of Company A, the RLS loan, and the intercompany loan. * **Commercial Property:** Understanding the implications for the industrial unit, the mortgage, and Company B's assets. * **Director's Duties:** Your lawyer will need to advise you on your duties as a director of both companies, particularly in the context of insolvency. There are potential risks to you personally, and you need to understand these. A good lawyer will be able to: * **Review all documentation:** This includes the RLS loan agreement, the intercompany loan agreement, the mortgage documents, the liquidation paperwork for Company A, and any correspondence from the liquidators. * **Assess your liabilities:** Determine the exact extent of Company B's liabilities (RLS, intercompany loan, mortgage). * **Advise on your options:** This is the crucial part. There may be more options than you realize. * **Negotiate with the liquidators:** Your lawyer can act as your advocate and try to negotiate a more favorable outcome. * **Challenge the liquidators (if appropriate):** If the liquidators are acting improperly or unreasonably, your lawyer can challenge their actions. * **Explore restructuring options:** See below. * **Defend you against any personal claims:** If the liquidators try to pursue you personally (e.g., for breach of director's duties), your lawyer can defend you. 2. **Do NOT Agree to Anything with the Liquidators:** Do not sign anything, do not make any promises, and do not agree to put Company B into administration with them *until you have received independent legal advice*. Their priority is to recover funds for Company A's creditors, not to protect your interests. 3. **Gather All Documentation:** Start collecting *every* document related to both companies: * Incorporation documents. * Loan agreements (RLS, intercompany, mortgage). * Financial statements for both companies. * Correspondence with the bank and the liquidators. * Property deeds and valuation reports for the industrial unit. * Any guarantees you have signed. 4. **Independent Valuation of the Industrial Unit:** Get an independent valuation of the industrial unit *immediately*. This will be crucial for negotiations and for assessing your options. Don't rely on the liquidators' valuation. 5. **Consider an Independent Insolvency Practitioner:** It may seem counter intuitive, but you might consider taking independent insolvency advice for *Company B*. **Possible Options (Your Lawyer Will Advise on These)** The key here is to explore *alternatives* to Company B going into administration with the same liquidators as Company A. Here are some possibilities your lawyer might discuss: * **Negotiation with the Liquidators:** It *might* be possible to negotiate a repayment plan for the intercompany loan, perhaps based on the value of the industrial unit and Company B's ability to generate income. * **Refinancing:** Could Company B refinance the mortgage and/or the RLS loan to consolidate the debt and make it more manageable? This would depend on the value of the unit and Company B's financial position. * **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** A CVA is a formal agreement with creditors to repay a portion of the debts over time. This could be an option for Company B to avoid administration. It requires the agreement of a majority of creditors (by value). * **Administration (with a *different* administrator):** If administration is unavoidable, it's crucial to try and ensure it's done by an administrator *of your choosing*, not the same one handling Company A's liquidation. This can give you more control over the process and potentially a better outcome. * **Pre-Pack Administration:** In some cases, a ""pre-pack"" administration might be possible. This involves selling the business (or assets) of Company B to a new company (perhaps one you set up) *before* the formal administration process begins. This can allow the business to continue trading and preserve value. *This is a complex and potentially controversial process, and you need expert legal advice.* * **Challenging the Cross-Guarantee:** While cross-guarantees are generally enforceable, there *might* be circumstances where it could be challenged, particularly if you weren't properly advised at the time it was signed. This is a long shot, but your lawyer should explore it. * **Reviewing Director's Actions:** Your lawyer will need to review your actions as a director of both companies to ensure you haven't breached any duties, particularly in the period leading up to Company A's liquidation. This is to protect you from potential personal liability. **Why It's Worth Fighting For** You've built these businesses over 17 years. That's a huge investment of time, effort, and passion. While the situation is dire, it's not necessarily hopeless. There are legal and financial tools available to try and salvage the situation, or at least minimize the damage. The key is to get expert advice *immediately* and to act strategically. Don't give up without exploring all your options. A good lawyer can help you navigate this incredibly complex situation and fight for the best possible outcome.

Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"This is an excellent question and a crucial distinction to understand. You're right about limited company debts generally staying with the company, but the situation is different when a personal debt is owed by a sole director. It's more complex than a simple reversal of the limited liability principle. Here's a breakdown: **The General Rule: Separate Legal Entities** * **Limited Company:** A limited company (LTD) is a separate legal entity from its directors and shareholders. This is the foundation of limited liability. The company's assets belong to the *company*, not to the individuals who own or run it. * **Personal Debts:** Personal debts are the responsibility of the individual who incurred them. **How Personal Debts Can Impact Company Assets (The Exceptions)** While company assets are generally protected, there are several ways a personal debt owed by a sole director can impact the company and potentially lead to assets being used to satisfy the debt. It's not about *seizing* assets directly in most cases, but rather about accessing the *value* the director holds *within* the company. 1. **Charging Order Over Shares:** This is the most common route. A creditor who has obtained a judgment against the director (meaning a court has ruled that the debt is owed) can apply for a ""charging order"" over the director's *shares* in the company. * **What it is:** A charging order doesn't immediately transfer ownership of the shares, but it acts like a security interest. It prevents the director from selling or transferring the shares without the creditor's consent. * **Order for Sale:** After obtaining a charging order, the creditor can then apply for an ""order for sale"" of the shares. This forces the sale of the shares to satisfy the debt. * **Impact on the Company:** This can be highly disruptive. If the director owns 100% of the shares, the creditor could effectively gain control of the company by buying the shares (or finding a buyer). Even if the director owns a smaller percentage, the forced sale can disrupt the company's ownership structure and operations. * **Defences:** There are very limited defences that stop a charging order. 2. **Director's Loan Account (DLA):** If the director has *borrowed* money from the company (a common situation), this creates a Director's Loan Account (DLA) that is in debit (the director owes the company money). * **Creditor's Access:** The creditor can pursue the director for repayment of the DLA. If the director can't repay, and the company is solvent, the company itself could be forced to demand repayment of the DLA from the director to satisfy the debt. This indirectly impacts company funds. * **Overdrawn DLA:** If the director has not paid tax on the money taken, this could have negative repurcussions. 3. **Dividend Income:** If the company is profitable and declares dividends, the director's share of those dividends can be targeted by the creditor. This is a direct way to access the director's income from the company. 4. **Salary:** The creditor can apply for an ""attachment of earnings order"" to deduct a portion of the director's salary directly from the company's payroll. This is a common way to enforce judgment debts. 5. **Insolvency of the Director (Bankruptcy):** If the director is declared bankrupt due to the personal debt, the trustee in bankruptcy will take control of *all* the director's assets, including their shares in the company. The trustee could then sell the shares to satisfy the director's creditors. This is similar to the charging order/order for sale process, but it's initiated through bankruptcy proceedings. 6. **Fraudulent or Wrongful Trading (Rare but Serious):** In very specific and limited circumstances, if the director has acted fraudulently or engaged in wrongful trading (e.g., continuing to trade the company while knowing it was insolvent and worsening the position of creditors), a court *might* ""pierce the corporate veil."" This is extremely rare, but it would mean the director could become *personally* liable for the company's debts, and therefore company assets could be directly at risk. This is *not* directly related to the director's personal debt, but it's a risk associated with running a company improperly. 7. **Transactions at an Undervalue/Preferences:** If a Director transfers assets, at a lower rate to another company/person, this could be reversed if the personal debt leads to bankrupcy. **Key Distinctions and Protections** * **Direct vs. Indirect:** It's important to distinguish between *direct* seizure of company assets (which is generally not allowed for a director's personal debt) and *indirect* access to the *value* the director holds within the company (through shares, DLA, dividends, etc.). * **Solvency of the Company:** The company's solvency is a major factor. If the company is healthy and profitable, the impact of the director's personal debt might be limited to their shares, dividends, or salary. If the company is struggling, the director's personal debt could exacerbate the situation and potentially lead to insolvency. * **Other Shareholders:** If there are other shareholders, their interests are also considered. A court is less likely to order the sale of shares if it would unfairly prejudice other shareholders. * **Legal Advice:** A director facing personal debt problems *must* seek legal advice from a solicitor specializing in insolvency and company law. There may be steps they can take to protect their interests and the company's assets. **In summary, while a limited company's assets are not *directly* seizable to satisfy a director's personal debt in most cases, the director's personal financial situation can significantly impact the company, and creditors have several legal avenues to access the value the director holds within the company. The most common route is a charging order over the director's shares, followed by an order for sale.** "	16.33554196357727	1	"[[""Does the lawyer ask which type of bankruptcy procedure has been opened against the director (if any)?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the requirements to be appointed as a director under English law?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to ss.250-251 IA 1986?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the principle of separate legal personality?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the exceptions to the principle of separate legal personality?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that directors owe fiduciary duties to the company?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to ss.171-177 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that piercing the corporate veil may occur as a result of the director breaching their fiduciary duties towards the company?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to relevant case law?"", ""Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]]"	9	[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	No|No|No|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	"You've found yourself in a very common, and very frustrating, situation. You're getting good instincts (don't pay for insolvency advice for a smaller debt, don't just blindly agree to a payment plan), and you're right to seek further clarification. Here's a breakdown of what's happening, your options, and how to handle this Utility Bidder debt, building on the excellent advice you likely received previously: **Key Points and Analysis** * **The Debt Collector's Goal:** The debt collector's primary goal is to get *you* to pay. They are incentivized to recover the money, and they will often use pressure tactics (like suggesting you ""find the money from somewhere"") to achieve that. They might not be fully informed about the nuances of company law, or they might choose to ignore them to pressure you. * **Outstanding Debt and Dissolution:** The debt collector is *partially* correct. Having an outstanding debt *can* be an objection to a company's dissolution (striking off). A creditor *can* object to the striking-off application if they are owed money. However, this doesn't mean you *can't* dissolve the company; it means the process might be delayed or complicated. * **Utility Bidder's Position:** Utility Bidder, as a creditor, has a right to try and recover the debt. The £1,000 likely represents the early termination fee in your energy contract. Whether that fee is *enforceable* depends on the specific terms of the contract you signed, but it's common for energy contracts to have such clauses. * **Company Assets vs. Personal Assets:** You've correctly identified the crucial distinction. The bakery equipment you personally owned *before* forming the company, or bought with your *personal* funds, remains *your* property, not the company's. The debt collector cannot touch these assets. The only assets that are relevant are those that belong to the *company*. Since the company mainly bought ingredients and small items, it's likely there are few, if any, company assets of significant value. * **No Trading, No Outstanding Payments:** The fact that you've ceased trading, settled with your landlord, and have no outstanding payments to suppliers is very important. This strengthens your position for a straightforward dissolution. * **Insolvency Practitioner (IP) is NOT Necessary:** The debt collector's suggestion to see an IP is almost certainly inappropriate in this situation. Engaging an IP for formal insolvency proceedings (like liquidation) would cost far more than the £1,000 debt. This is a scare tactic. **Your Options and Recommended Course of Action** 1. **Respond in Writing (Crucially Important):** Do *not* engage in further phone calls with the debt collector. Respond *in writing* (email is fine, but keep a copy). This creates a clear record of your communication. 2. **Content of Your Response:** Your written response should be polite but firm, and should include the following points: * **Acknowledge the Debt:** Briefly acknowledge that you are aware of the claimed debt. * **State the Company Has Ceased Trading:** Clearly state that the company ceased trading on December 24th, 2023, and vacated its premises on January 18th, 2024. * **State the Company Has No Assets:** State that the company has no assets with which to pay the debt. Be clear about this. You can say something like: ""The company's primary expenditures were on consumable ingredients and minor equipment replacements. There are no remaining company assets of significant value."" * **Refer to the Striking-Off Application:** State that you have applied to Companies House to dissolve the company (striking off). * **Reject the Payment Plan (For Now):** Do *not* agree to a payment plan at this stage. You can say something like: ""Given the company's lack of assets, a payment plan is not feasible."" * **Request Documentation:** Ask them to provide *full documentation* of the debt, including: * A copy of the original contract with Utility Bidder. * A detailed breakdown of the £1,000 termination fee, showing how it was calculated. * Proof that Utility Bidder properly notified the *company* (not you personally) of the debt. * **Politely Push Back:** Add at the end ""I will wait for the requested documentation from yourselves, until this point I will be taking no further action."" 3. **Companies House Striking-Off (DS01):** * **Continue with the Application:** If you've already submitted the DS01 form to Companies House, continue with the process. * **Potential Objection:** Be prepared for Utility Bidder (or the debt collection agency) to potentially object to the striking off. If they do, Companies House will notify you. * **Responding to an Objection:** If an objection is received, Companies House will usually put the striking-off process on hold. You will then have a limited time (usually a few months) to resolve the issue with the creditor. If you don't, the striking-off application will lapse, and you'll have to start again. *This is why your written response is so important.* 4. **If Utility Bidder Objects:** * **Negotiation (Possible, but Limited):** If Utility Bidder objects, you *might* consider negotiating a *small* settlement offer, *purely as a commercial decision* to avoid further hassle and allow the striking off to proceed. However, *do not* offer more than you can afford, and *do not* admit personal liability. Any settlement should be explicitly stated as being made by you *personally*, without prejudice, to facilitate the company's dissolution, and *not* as an admission of personal liability. * **Standing Your Ground:** If Utility Bidder is unreasonable, you can stand your ground. If the company genuinely has no assets, there's nothing they can realistically recover. They *could* theoretically pursue formal insolvency proceedings, but this is highly unlikely for a £1,000 debt, as it would cost them far more than they could recover. * **Defend the Striking Off:** Provide companies house with all the evidence. 5. **Do NOT Use Personal Funds (Unless Absolutely Necessary):** Resist the urge to use your personal funds to pay off the company debt, unless it's a small, commercially sensible settlement as described above. **Possible Outcomes** * **Best Case:** Utility Bidder reviews your response, realizes the company has no assets, and drops the matter. The striking-off proceeds. * **Likely Case:** Utility Bidder objects to the striking off, causing a delay. You may need to negotiate a small settlement or stand your ground, knowing they are unlikely to pursue formal insolvency. * **Worst Case (Unlikely):** Utility Bidder pursues formal insolvency proceedings. This is highly unlikely given the small debt and lack of company assets. **In summary, your best course of action is to respond to the debt collector in writing, clearly stating the company's position (ceased trading, no assets), requesting full documentation of the debt, and continuing with the Companies House striking-off application. Be prepared for a potential objection, but don't be intimidated into paying a debt the company cannot afford. Stick to the facts, document everything, and don't be pressured into using your personal funds unless it's a small, commercially justifiable settlement.** "	24.09851050376892	1	"[[""Does the lawyer ask how the company was dissolved?"", ""Does the lawyer ask for the forms submitted for dissolving a company?"", ""Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	You're in a tricky situation, but one that's not uncommon in insolvency proceedings. A Creditors' Committee that isn't acting in the best interests of *all* creditors is a serious problem. Here's a breakdown of your options, how to approach them, and the legal framework that governs this, assuming this is a UK insolvency situation (as the terminology suggests). The specific process will depend on *which type of insolvency procedure* the company is in (Administration, Liquidation, CVA, etc.). I'll cover the most common ones. **Key Principles and Considerations** * **Purpose of a Creditors' Committee:** The committee's role is to represent the interests of *all* unsecured creditors, to work with the insolvency practitioner (IP) (administrator, liquidator, supervisor), to monitor the progress of the insolvency, and to approve certain actions by the IP (like their fees). * **Committee Membership:** The committee is usually made up of representatives of the unsecured creditors. There are rules about who can be on the committee (e.g., they must be a creditor or represent a creditor). * **No Voting at Formation (Sometimes):** You mention the committee was formed quickly without voting. This *can* happen, particularly in Administrations, where speed is often of the essence. The IP has some discretion in the initial formation, but there are usually provisions for later changes. * **Duty to All Creditors:** The committee members have a duty to act in the best interests of *all* unsecured creditors, not just themselves or a particular group. **Can You Remove/Replace/Add Members? Yes, But...** Yes, it is possible to remove, replace, and add members to a Creditors' Committee, but there are specific procedures to follow. The exact process depends on the type of insolvency: **1. Administration (Most Common Scenario):** * **The Rules:** The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (and similar rules in Scotland and Northern Ireland) govern this. Specifically, look at Rules 17.12 to 17.21. * **Removal:** * A committee member can be removed by a resolution of the *creditors*. This usually requires a majority in *value* of the creditors present (in person or by proxy) at a meeting called for that purpose. * A committee member can also be removed by the court if they are not properly fulfilling their duties. * A committee member can resign. * **Addition/Replacement:** * New members can be added by a resolution of the *creditors*, following a similar process to removal. The rules specify minimum and maximum numbers of committee members (usually between 3 and 5). * If a member resigns or is removed, a replacement can be appointed by the creditors. * **How to Do It:** 1. **Gather Support:** You need to get support from other creditors. You'll need to convince a majority in *value* to vote for your proposals. 2. **Request a Meeting:** You can request the administrator to call a meeting of creditors to consider resolutions to remove/add/replace committee members. The request must be made in writing and must be supported by a sufficient number of creditors (usually at least 10% in value, or 10% in number, or 10 individual creditors - check the specific rules). Alternatively, creditors representing more than 25% in value can call a meeting themselves. 3. **Notice of the Meeting:** The administrator must give proper notice of the meeting to all creditors, specifying the resolutions to be considered. 4. **Voting:** Creditors can vote in person or by proxy. 5. **Court Application (If Necessary):** If you can't get enough support from creditors, or if the administrator refuses to call a meeting, you can apply to the court for an order to remove a committee member or to compel the administrator to act. **2. Liquidation (Compulsory or Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation - CVL):** * **The Rules:** Again, the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 govern this, with similar provisions to Administration. * **Removal/Addition:** The process is very similar to Administration. Creditors can vote to remove or add members at a creditors' meeting. The liquidator has less initial discretion in forming the committee than an administrator. * **How to Do It:** The process is essentially the same as in Administration: gather support, request a meeting, give notice, vote, and potentially apply to the court. **3. Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** * **The Rules:** The CVA proposal itself will usually set out the rules for the Creditors' Committee (if there is one – CVAs don't *always* have a committee). The Insolvency Rules also apply. * **Removal/Addition:** The process will depend on what the CVA proposal says. If the proposal is silent, the general principles of creditor democracy apply (i.e., creditors can vote to change the committee). * **How to do it:** Follow the terms set in the CVA. **Practical Steps and Considerations** 1. **Document the Problems:** Before taking any action, carefully document *specific examples* of how the committee is not acting in the best interests of all creditors. Be factual and avoid personal attacks. 2. **Communicate with Other Creditors:** Talk to other creditors and explain your concerns. Build a coalition of support. 3. **Seek Legal Advice:** This is *highly recommended*. A solicitor specializing in insolvency law can advise you on the best strategy, the specific rules that apply to your situation, and the likely outcome of any action you take. They can also help you draft the necessary notices and resolutions. 4. **Consider the Costs:** Legal action can be expensive. Weigh the costs against the potential benefits. 5. **Be Prepared for Resistance:** The existing committee members may resist your efforts to remove or replace them. 6. **Focus on the Best Interests of *All* Creditors:** Remember that your goal is to ensure the committee represents the interests of *all* unsecured creditors, not just your own. **In summary, you *can* take action to remove, replace, or add members to a Creditors' Committee, but you must follow the correct legal procedures, which depend on the type of insolvency. Gathering support from other creditors and seeking legal advice are crucial steps.** 	19.21705412864685	1	"[[""Does the lawyer ask what kind of formal insolvency procedure has the company been admitted to?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the duties of the members of the creditors\u2019 committee?

Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	"This is a much better situation than many companies face, but it still requires careful handling to ensure you close down the business properly. Here's a breakdown of your options, focusing on the telecoms contract and whether you need a liquidator: **Key Points and Analysis** * **Solvent Company:** You've described a solvent company. You have no debts (other than the potential early termination fee from the telecoms contract), no overdrawn director's loan accounts, no bounce back loans, and you can pay your VAT and Corporation Tax. This is crucial. * **One Director Leaving:** The departure of one director, leaving the company unable to continue trading, is a common reason for closure. * **Telecoms Contract:** This is your *only* outstanding liability. The 7-year remaining term is significant, and the early termination fee is likely to be substantial. This is the core issue. * **Unreasonable Telecoms Provider:** Unfortunately, this is also common. Telecoms contracts are notoriously difficult to get out of. **Do You Need a Liquidator? Probably Not, BUT...** Given that the company is solvent and the *only* issue is the telecoms contract, formal liquidation is *likely* unnecessary and would be disproportionately expensive. However, you can't just walk away and ignore the telecoms contract. You need a strategy to deal with it. Here are your options: **1. Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL) - The ""Overkill"" Option (Probably Not Necessary)** * **What it is:** An MVL is a formal insolvency process for *solvent* companies. A liquidator is appointed to wind up the company's affairs, pay off any creditors, and distribute any remaining assets to the shareholders. * **Pros:** Provides absolute certainty and finality. The liquidator deals with all creditors, including the telecoms provider. It protects you from any potential future claims. * **Cons:** Expensive (liquidator's fees can be several thousand pounds). Unnecessary in your situation, given the single creditor and solvency. * **Conclusion:** Almost certainly not the right option for you. It's using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. **2. Negotiate with the Telecoms Provider (Again) - The Preferred Option** * **What to do:** Even though they've been unreasonable so far, try negotiating *again*, but this time with a slightly different approach: * **Formal Written Notice:** Send a formal written notice (email is acceptable, but keep a copy) stating that: * The company is ceasing to trade due to the departure of a director. * The company is solvent and has no other debts. * You are seeking a *reasonable* settlement of the contract. * You are prepared to apply for dissolution (striking off) if a reasonable settlement cannot be reached. * **Offer a Settlement:** Make a *realistic* offer to settle the contract. Don't offer the full remaining value – that's what they want, and it's unreasonable. Consider offering a percentage (e.g., 10-25%) of the remaining contract value, justifying it by saying this is all the company can afford and it's better than them getting nothing if the company is struck off. * **Highlight the ""No Assets"" Point:** Emphasize that the company has *no assets* beyond what's needed to pay its final taxes. This is crucial. They need to understand that pursuing the full amount is likely to be fruitless. * **Escalate:** If you're dealing with a low-level customer service representative, ask to speak to someone in their legal or cancellations department with more authority. * **Pros:** Potentially the cheapest and quickest solution. * **Cons:** The telecoms provider might still be unreasonable. * **Conclusion:** This is your *best first step*. Be persistent, be reasonable, and be prepared to walk away (to the next step) if they won't budge. **3. Dissolution (Striking Off) with a Calculated Risk - The Most Likely Option** * **What it is:** This is the process of applying to Companies House to have the company struck off the register (Form DS01). It's a simple and inexpensive process for solvent companies with no assets. * **The Risk:** The telecoms provider *can* object to the striking off if they are owed money. If they object, the striking-off process will be put on hold. * **How to Mitigate the Risk:** * **Prior Written Notice:** As described in Option 2, give the telecoms provider *written notice* of your intention to apply for striking off. This is crucial. It shows you're not trying to avoid the debt, but that the company simply has no funds. * **Transparency:** Be completely transparent with Companies House. On the DS01 form, you must declare that you've notified all creditors. * **Be Prepared to Negotiate (Again):** If the telecoms provider objects, you might have to negotiate a small settlement (as a commercial decision) to allow the striking off to proceed. But, again, don't offer more than is absolutely necessary, and make it clear it's *not* an admission of personal liability. * **Standing Your Ground:** If the telecoms provider is completely unreasonable, you can stand your ground. If the company genuinely has no assets, they are unlikely to pursue formal insolvency proceedings (which would cost them far more than they could recover). They might make threats, but they are unlikely to follow through. * **Pros:** Inexpensive and relatively straightforward. * **Cons:** Risk of objection, potential delay, and possible need for a small settlement. * **Conclusion:** This is likely your most practical option, but it requires careful handling and a willingness to potentially negotiate a small settlement if necessary. **4. Assignment/Novation (Unlikely, but Worth Considering)** * **What It is**: If a new business owner took over the business. **Key Steps and Timeline** 1. **Negotiate with Telecoms Provider (Immediately):** Start with a formal written notice and a reasonable settlement offer. 2. **Prepare for Striking Off:** While negotiating, prepare the DS01 form and gather all necessary information. 3. **Submit DS01 (If Negotiation Fails):** If negotiation fails, submit the DS01 form to Companies House, ensuring you've notified the telecoms provider. 4. **Deal with Any Objection:** If the telecoms provider objects, decide whether to negotiate a small settlement or stand your ground. 5. **Finalise accounts and taxes.** **Important Considerations** * **Director's Personal Liability:** Ensure you haven't given any *personal guarantees* related to the telecoms contract. If you have, the situation is much more serious, and you'll need separate legal advice. * **Document Everything:** Keep meticulous records of all communications, offers, and actions taken. * **Remaining Director:** The remaining director must deal with the company closure. **In summary, while you *could* technically use an MVL, it's almost certainly unnecessary and overly expensive in your situation. Your best approach is to try and negotiate a reasonable settlement with the telecoms provider and, if that fails, proceed with a carefully managed striking-off application, being prepared for a potential objection and a possible small settlement.** "	23.59732341766357	1	"[[""Does the lawyer say the company should not usually require liquidators purely for the reason of being unable to terminate the telecoms contract?"", ""Does the lawyer say that potentially, the company may face an insolvent liquidation if the telecom company refuses to compromise or if the contract is not assigned to a third party?

Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	"This is a tough situation, and unfortunately, you've made a significant error. Commercial lease break clauses are notoriously strict, and even a small deviation from the requirements can invalidate the break notice. Here's a breakdown of where you stand, what you can (and can't) do, and how to approach this: **Where You Stand Legally (Not Good)** * **Strict Compliance:** Break clauses in commercial leases are interpreted *strictly*. This means that *any* failure to comply with the requirements, even a minor one like being 7 days late, can render the break notice invalid. This is a well-established principle of contract law. * **Invalid Notice:** Your notice is almost certainly invalid. You failed to give the required 3 months' notice, and that's a fundamental breach of the break clause conditions. * **Liable for Remaining Term:** Because your break notice is likely invalid, you are legally bound by the lease for the remaining two years. This means you're responsible for paying rent, service charges, and fulfilling all other obligations under the lease until the end of the 5-year term. * **Landlord's Position:** The landlord is within their legal rights to hold you to the full term of the lease. They don't have to accept your late notice. The prior discussions and viewings are *not* legally binding unless they resulted in a formal, written agreement to vary the lease terms (which it sounds like they didn't). * **""Time is of the Essence"":** Break clauses often include the phrase ""time is of the essence."" This emphasizes the importance of strict adherence to deadlines. Even if that phrase *isn't* explicitly stated, courts generally treat time as being of the essence in break clauses. **What You *Can't* Do** * **Rely on Prior Discussions:** The informal discussions about leaving early and the viewings don't create a legal obligation on the landlord to accept your late notice. Verbal agreements are very difficult to enforce in commercial property matters. * **Claim ""Unfairness"":** The law doesn't generally consider ""unfairness"" as a reason to invalidate a properly drafted contract. The strictness of break clauses is well-known, and it's the tenant's responsibility to comply. * **Force the Landlord to Accept:** You can't force the landlord to accept your late notice. **What You *Can* Do (Mitigation Strategies)** Although your legal position is weak, there are still steps you can take to try and mitigate the damage: 1. **Formal Apology and Explanation:** Immediately send a formal, written apology to the landlord (or their agent). Acknowledge the error, explain the circumstances (the person responsible being out of action), and express your sincere regret. This doesn't change the legal position, but it can help with negotiations. 2. **Negotiate (Your Best Hope):** This is your primary strategy. You need to try and negotiate a compromise with the landlord. * **Offer a Financial Incentive:** Offer the landlord a financial incentive to accept your late notice. This could be: * Paying a lump sum (e.g., equivalent to a few months' rent). * Agreeing to pay a slightly higher rent for a short period. * Offering to cover the landlord's costs in finding a new tenant. * **Highlight the Previous Discussions:** While not legally binding, remind the landlord of the previous discussions and the fact that they had already started looking for new tenants. This shows that your intention to leave wasn't a surprise. * **Emphasize Cooperation:** Stress your willingness to cooperate fully in finding a new tenant. Offer to assist with viewings and marketing. * **Be Realistic:** Understand that the landlord is in a strong position. You'll likely need to offer a significant concession to get them to agree. * **Document everything**: Keep a record of your conversations. 3. **""Without Prejudice"" Offer:** When making any financial offer, clearly state that it's made ""without prejudice."" This means that the offer can't be used against you in court if negotiations fail. 4. **Seek Legal Advice (Urgently):** Consult a solicitor who specializes in commercial property law *immediately*. They can: * Review the lease in detail. * Advise you on your legal position and options. * Negotiate with the landlord (or their solicitor) on your behalf. * Help you draft any formal agreements. * Give an opinion on Landlord's actions. 5. **Explore Subletting/Assignment:** Check your lease to see if it allows you to sublet the premises or assign the lease to another tenant. This could be a way to mitigate your losses if you can find a suitable replacement tenant. *However*, you'll almost certainly need the landlord's consent, and they may be reluctant to give it given the current situation. 6. **Consider Surrender:** If negotiations fail and you can't find a replacement tenant, you could try to negotiate a ""surrender"" of the lease. This is where you and the landlord agree to terminate the lease early. The landlord will likely require a significant payment in return for agreeing to a surrender. 7. **Mitigation of losses:** If you are unable to come to a new agreement, the Landlord is obliged to mitigate losses. **Possible Outcomes** * **Best Case:** The landlord accepts your apology and a financial incentive, and agrees to treat your notice as valid (or agrees to a surrender on favorable terms). * **Likely Case:** You have to negotiate a compromise with the landlord, involving a significant financial payment to get out of the lease early. * **Worst Case:** The landlord refuses to compromise, and you're liable for the full remaining two years of the lease. You'll have to explore subletting/assignment or try to negotiate a surrender on less favorable terms. **Key Takeaways** * **Break Clauses are Strict:** This situation highlights the critical importance of strictly complying with break clause requirements in commercial leases. * **Negotiation is Key:** Your best hope is to negotiate a compromise with the landlord. * **Legal Advice is Essential:** Seek legal advice immediately to understand your options and protect your interests. * **Document Everything:** Keep records of everything. This is a difficult situation, but it's not necessarily hopeless. Acting quickly, seeking legal advice, and being prepared to negotiate are your best strategies. "	20.076408624649048	1		0		0	
Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	"You've provided a very clear and comprehensive overview of your situation, and you're right, it's a story that many businesses are facing right now. It's good that you're proactively seeking advice and considering your options before things potentially get worse. Here's a breakdown of your situation, the options available, and how to proceed, incorporating the context of the ""SpongeBob"" post (which refers to the ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" strategy, a tongue-in-cheek term for a managed wind-down of a company). **Key Points and Analysis** * **Limited Company Structure:** You're operating as a limited company, which is crucial for limiting personal liability. * **Solvent vs. Insolvent:** This is the *critical* distinction. At the moment, you're describing a company that *might* be heading towards insolvency, but isn't necessarily insolvent *yet*. You can still pay your HMRC and Corporation Tax, and you've been making BBL repayments. The key question is whether you can realistically pay your debts *as they fall due*. If you can't, the company is insolvent. * **Bounce Back Loan (BBL):** £14k outstanding. This is a significant liability, but crucially, it's a company debt, not a personal one (unless you provided a personal guarantee, which is very unlikely with a BBL). * **Overdraft (OD):** £6k outstanding, with a director's guarantee. This is a *personal* liability. You are personally responsible for repaying this, regardless of what happens to the company. * **Outstanding Invoices:** £7k. This indicates potential cash flow problems and a risk of insolvency. * **Lease Cars:** Leased through the company, *without* director's guarantees (good!). This means they are company liabilities, not personal ones. * **Declining Customer Base:** This is the underlying cause of your problems and a strong indicator that the business may not be viable long-term. * **Meeting with Accountant:** This is a very good first step. Your accountant can provide tailored financial advice. **Options (and How They Relate to the SpongeBob Strategy)** The ""SpongeBob"" strategy generally refers to a controlled wind-down of a company, aiming to minimize losses and avoid formal insolvency proceedings if possible. Here's how it applies to your situation, and a breakdown of your other options: 1. **Managed Wind-Down (""SpongeBob"") - The Most Likely Best Option (Initially):** * **What it is:** This involves systematically reducing the company's operations, collecting outstanding debts, selling assets, and paying off creditors *in the correct order of priority* (see below). The goal is to cease trading and dissolve the company without needing formal insolvency. * **How it applies to you:** This seems like the most appropriate starting point, given your current situation. * **Steps:** 1. **Cease Trading:** Stop taking on new orders or incurring new expenses. 2. **Collect Debts:** Aggressively pursue payment of the £7k in outstanding invoices. 3. **Sell Assets:** Sell any remaining company assets (including the lease cars if possible – see below). 4. **Pay Creditors (in the Correct Order):** This is *crucially* important. The order of priority is generally: * **Secured Creditors (with fixed charges):** Likely none in your case. * **Expenses of the winding up:** Costs you will incur with stopping. * **Preferential Creditors:** Includes certain employee claims (if you have employees) and some HMRC debts (but *not* all – Corporation Tax and VAT are usually *unsecured*). * **Secured Creditors (with floating charges):** Possibly the bank with the overdraft, *but* their security is likely over the company's assets, not your personal guarantee. Your personal guarantee is a separate issue. * **Unsecured Creditors:** This includes the BBL, the lease car companies, trade suppliers (the £7k), and potentially some HMRC debts. 5. **Deal with the Overdraft:** Use the proceeds from asset sales to pay off the *personally guaranteed* overdraft *as a priority* (after any secured creditors with a fixed charge, which you likely don't have). This protects you personally. 6. **Deal with the BBL:** Once secured and preferential creditors (if any) are paid, and you've dealt with the overdraft, any remaining funds should be distributed *pro-rata* (proportionately) to the unsecured creditors, including the BBL lender. You *don't* have to prioritize the BBL over other unsecured creditors. 7. **Deal with the Lease Cars:** Contact the lease companies. Explain the situation. They may allow you to terminate the leases early, possibly with a penalty. Try to negotiate the lowest possible termination fee. If they won't negotiate, you'll have to include them in the *pro-rata* distribution to unsecured creditors. 8. **Dissolution (Striking Off):** Once all assets are sold, and creditors are paid as much as possible (in the correct order), apply to Companies House to dissolve the company (Form DS01). 2. **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) - A More Formal Option (If Necessary):** * **What it is:** This is a formal insolvency process for *insolvent* companies. You, as directors, appoint a liquidator to wind up the company's affairs, realize assets, and distribute funds to creditors (in the correct order). * **When it's necessary:** If you can't pay your debts as they fall due, or if the managed wind-down proves impossible (e.g., creditors are threatening legal action), a CVL may be necessary. * **Pros:** Provides a structured and legally compliant way to close down the company. Protects you from further creditor action (but *not* from the personal guarantee on the overdraft). * **Cons:** More expensive than a managed wind-down (liquidator's fees). * **Conclusion:** Potentially needed if the company slips in to insolvency 3. **Administration- Pre Pack (Selling the business name/assets):** * **What it is:** Where someone buys the assets, not the debt. 4. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) - Unlikely in Your Case:** * **What it is:** A CVA is a formal agreement with creditors to repay a portion of your debts over time. It's used to rescue a struggling company, not to close it down. * **Why it's unlikely:** Given that you've already decided the business is not viable, a CVA is probably not appropriate. **Key Considerations and Actions** * **Insolvency Definition:** Be very clear about whether the company is *currently* insolvent. If you can't pay your debts as they fall due, you *must* stop trading and seek advice from an insolvency practitioner (IP). * **Director's Duties:** If the company is insolvent, your duties as directors shift from acting in the best interests of the shareholders to acting in the best interests of the *creditors*. You must not worsen the position of creditors. * **Wrongful Trading:** If you continue to trade while knowing the company is insolvent and you worsen the position of creditors, you could be held *personally* liable for some of the company's debts. This is a serious risk. * **Document Everything:** Keep meticulous records of all decisions, communications with creditors, asset sales, and payments made. * **Personal Guarantee:** Prioritize paying off the personally guaranteed overdraft. * **Seek Professional Advice:** Your accountant is a good starting point, but if you suspect the company is insolvent, or if you're unsure about any of these steps, you *must* seek advice from a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP). They can provide impartial advice and guide you through the process. **In summary, your best initial approach is likely a managed wind-down (""SpongeBob"" strategy), focusing on collecting debts, selling assets, and paying creditors in the correct order of priority. Prioritize paying off the personally guaranteed overdraft. If the company becomes insolvent, or if the managed wind-down proves impossible, a Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) may be necessary. Seek advice from your accountant and, if necessary, a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP).** "	23.95743012428284	1	"[[""Does the lawyer mention the key liquidation options available to the company (i.e. members\u2019 voluntary liquidation and creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation)?"", ""Does the lawyer mention the key restructuring options available to the company (i.e. administration and company voluntary arrangements)?"", ""Does the lawyer mention other important restructuring options (i.e. pre-packaged administration, schemes of arrangement and restructuring plans)?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to the relevant sections of the law (Insolvency Act 1986 and Companies Act 2006) to describe the liquidation and restructuring options available to the company?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that directors owe fiduciary duties to the company (ss.171-177 CA 2006)?"", ""Does the lawyer refers to the consequences associated with misfeasance (s.212 IA 1986) and wrongful trading (s.214 IA 1986)?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the directors\u2019 duties when the company is insolvent?"", ""Does the lawyer warn that some transactions made soon before insolvency could be challenged as being unlawful (ss.238-239, 244-245, 423 IA 1986)?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to relevant case law?"", ""Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3]]"	14	[3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3]	25	Yes|Yes|No|No|No|Yes|Yes|No|No|Yes|
Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	"This is a very serious situation, and it's understandable that you're terrified. It's good that you've recognized the problem and are seeking advice. The previous accountant's actions (or inactions) have put you in a very difficult position. However, while the situation is serious, bankruptcy is *not* necessarily inevitable, and there *are* steps you can take. Let's break this down: **Key Issues and Analysis** * **Illegal Dividends:** This is the core problem. Dividends can only be paid out of *distributable profits* (profits after tax). If the company didn't have sufficient distributable profits, taking dividends is illegal. The £35,000 is now effectively a debt you owe *back to the company*. This is often treated as an overdrawn director's loan account (DLA). * **Messy Accounts:** The previous accountant's incompetence has created this situation and made it difficult to assess the true financial position. * **Higher Tax Liabilities:** This exacerbates the problem, likely reducing the available profits even further and increasing the amount of illegal dividends. * **No Personal Assets:** This makes your personal situation precarious, but it also means there's nothing for a trustee in bankruptcy to seize (beyond the usual personal belongings threshold). * **Company Assets:** £15,000 in equipment and cash/receivables. This is *something*, but it's unlikely to be enough to cover the illegal dividends, personal tax, and any other company debts. * **Liquidator's Advice:** The liquidator's assessment that you'll be forced into personal bankruptcy is a *possible* outcome, but it's not the *only* possible outcome. It's important to remember that a liquidator's primary focus is on formal insolvency procedures. * **Future Prospects:** Bankruptcy *does* have consequences for your credit rating and ability to be a company director in the future, but it's not necessarily ""ruining"" your future. It's a serious step, but it's also a way to get a fresh start. * **Current Climate:** The current economic situation reduces the companies ability to make money. **You Absolutely Need Independent Advice (and a Second Opinion)** The liquidator you spoke to may be correct, but you need a second opinion from someone who isn't solely focused on formal insolvency. You need advice that explores *all* possible options, including alternatives to bankruptcy. 1. **Insolvency Practitioner (IP) - A *Different* One:** Seek advice from a *different* licensed insolvency practitioner (IP). Explain the situation *fully*, including the previous accountant's negligence. A good IP will: * **Review the Accounts:** Thoroughly review the company's accounts (with the help of your new accountant) to determine the *exact* extent of the illegal dividends and the company's overall financial position. * **Explore All Options:** Discuss *all* possible options, including: * **Negotiation with HMRC:** See below. * **Time to Pay Arrangement (with HMRC and potentially the company):** See below. * **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** (Unlikely, but should be considered). * **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** (A possibility, but not necessarily leading to personal bankruptcy). * **Personal Bankruptcy:** (A last resort). * **Advise on Director's Duties:** Explain your duties as a director, particularly in the context of potential insolvency. * **Represent You:** If necessary, represent you in negotiations with HMRC or other creditors. 2. **Solicitor Specializing in Insolvency and Director's Duties:** It's also highly advisable to consult a solicitor who specializes in insolvency law and director's duties. They can: * **Advise on Potential Liabilities:** Advise you on your potential *personal* liabilities arising from the illegal dividends and any other actions you've taken as a director. * **Defend You:** Defend you against any claims from HMRC or the liquidator (if a CVL is pursued). * **Advise on the Previous Accountant:** Advise you on whether you have a claim against your previous accountant for professional negligence (see below). **Possible Options (Beyond Bankruptcy)** * **Negotiation with HMRC:** This is crucial. HMRC is often the largest creditor in these situations (due to unpaid corporation tax, PAYE, and potentially penalties). You (or your IP/solicitor) should contact HMRC *immediately* and explain the situation: * **Full Disclosure:** Be completely transparent about the illegal dividends and the previous accountant's errors. * **Propose a Repayment Plan:** Offer to repay the illegal dividends and any outstanding tax over time. This is where a ""Time to Pay"" (TTP) arrangement comes in. * **Highlight the Accountant's Negligence:** Emphasize that the situation was caused by the previous accountant's incompetence, not by deliberate wrongdoing on your part. * **Show Willingness to Cooperate:** Demonstrate your willingness to cooperate fully with HMRC to resolve the issue. * **Time to Pay (TTP) Arrangement:** A TTP is a formal agreement with HMRC to repay tax debts over an agreed period (usually up to 12 months, but sometimes longer). HMRC is often willing to agree to TTPs if they believe it's the best way to recover the debt. * **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** A CVA is a formal agreement between the company and its creditors to repay a portion of its debts over time. It's used to *rescue* a struggling company, not to close it down. It's unlikely to be suitable if the business is truly no longer viable, but it *should* be considered as a possibility. * **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) *without* Personal Bankruptcy:** A CVL is a formal insolvency process where the company's assets are liquidated, and the proceeds are distributed to creditors. It *doesn't automatically* lead to personal bankruptcy. If the only significant company debt is the overdrawn DLA (representing the illegal dividends), and you have no personal guarantees for other company debts, a CVL might be a way to close down the company without you becoming bankrupt. The liquidator would pursue you for the £35,000, but if you have no assets, they can't recover anything from you *personally*. **Action Plan** 1. **Get Independent Advice (Immediately):** Contact a *different* IP and a solicitor specializing in insolvency. 2. **Gather Information:** Provide them with *all* relevant information, including the company's accounts, tax returns, correspondence with HMRC, and details of the illegal dividends. 3. **Negotiate with HMRC:** Your IP/solicitor should contact HMRC as a priority to explain the situation and propose a repayment plan. 4. **Consider a Claim Against the Previous Accountant:** If the previous accountant was negligent, you may have a claim against them for professional negligence. This could potentially help you recover some of the losses you've suffered. Discuss this with your solicitor. 5. **Be Prepared for Different Outcomes:** Be prepared for the possibility of a CVL, and potentially even personal bankruptcy, but don't assume it's inevitable. There are often ways to mitigate the situation. **Don't give up hope. While this is a very serious situation, it's not necessarily insurmountable. Getting the right advice and acting quickly are crucial.** "	21.37112236022949	1	"[[""Does the lawyer mention the key liquidation options available to the company (i.e. members\u2019 voluntary liquidation and creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation)?"", ""Does the lawyer mention the key bankruptcy options (e.g. bankruptcy, IVA, restructuring plan) available to the company director?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to the relevant sections of the law (Insolvency Act 1986 and Companies Act 2006) to describe the liquidation and restructuring options available to the company?"", ""Does the lawyer mention the potential civil liability of the previous accountants for failing to act according to a professional standard?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that directors owe fiduciary duties to the company (ss.171-177 CA 2006)?

Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	"You're touching on a complex area of TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006), and your recollection is partially correct, but with some crucial nuances. It's not *quite* as simple as just taking over premises in the same sector. Here's a breakdown of how TUPE applies in situations like the butcher shop example: **The Core Principles of TUPE** TUPE's purpose is to protect employees' rights when the business (or part of a business) they work for changes hands. There are two main types of transfer covered by TUPE: 1. **Standard Business Transfer:** This is the classic scenario where a business (or part of a business) is sold as a going concern. The key here is that an ""economic entity"" is transferred, retaining its identity after the transfer. 2. **Service Provision Change (SPC):** This is where TUPE gets more complicated, and it's the relevant type for your butcher shop example. An SPC occurs in three situations: * **Outsourcing:** A client engages a contractor to do work on its behalf (e.g., a company outsources its cleaning services). * **Insourcing:** A client takes activities back in-house that were previously done by a contractor (e.g., the company brings its cleaning services back in-house). * **Contractor-to-Contractor Change:** A client engages a new contractor to do work that was previously done by a different contractor (e.g., the company switches cleaning contractors). **The Butcher Shop Example: Is it a TUPE Transfer?** The key question is whether a ""Service Provision Change"" has occurred, and specifically, whether the *activities* carried out by the new butcher are ""fundamentally the same"" as those carried out by the old butcher. It's *not* enough that it's the same type of business (a butcher shop) in the same location. Here's the crucial test, established by case law (primarily the *Cheesman v R Brewer Contracts Ltd* case, and subsequent rulings): * **Activities, Not Just Sector:** It's not about the *sector* (butchery), it's about the specific *activities* carried out. Are the *activities* of the new butcher ""fundamentally the same"" as those of the old butcher? * **""Fundamentally the Same"":** This doesn't mean *identical*. There can be some differences, but the core activities must be the same. For example: * **Old Butcher:** Sold meat, made sausages, prepared cuts for customers, possibly offered some pre-prepared meals. * **New Butcher:** Sells meat, makes sausages, prepares cuts for customers. This is likely to be considered ""fundamentally the same,"" even if the new butcher uses different suppliers or has a slightly different product range. * **New Butcher (Different):** Sells only pre-packaged meat from a central supplier, doesn't make sausages or prepare cuts on-site, and focuses on a different type of customer (e.g., wholesale rather than retail). This is *less* likely to be considered ""fundamentally the same."" * **Client:** In a standard business transfer, it's obvious who the ""client"" is (the business being sold). In an SPC, it can be less clear. In the butcher shop example, there isn't a traditional ""client"" in the same way there would be with, say, an outsourced cleaning contract. The ""client"" is, in effect, the general public who buy meat. The key is whether the *activities* are being carried out for the same (or substantially the same) group of customers. If the new butcher targets a completely different market segment (e.g., only supplying restaurants), it weakens the argument for an SPC. * **Organised Grouping of Employees:** There must have been an organised grouping of employees whose principal purpose was carrying out the activities. * **Assets:** Taking on the premises *alone* is not enough to trigger TUPE. However, if the new butcher also takes on significant assets of the old butcher (e.g., equipment, stock, customer lists), this *strengthens* the argument that an ""economic entity"" has been transferred, making a TUPE transfer more likely. The *absence* of asset transfer doesn't automatically rule out TUPE in an SPC, but it makes it less likely. **Applying This to the Butcher Shop** * **Likely TUPE (Scenario 1):** If the new butcher opens in the same premises, sells similar products to similar customers, and uses some of the old butcher's equipment (even if they buy it from the administrator), it's *highly likely* that TUPE would apply. The ""activities"" are fundamentally the same. * **Possibly TUPE (Scenario 2):** If the new butcher opens in the same premises, sells similar products, but makes significant changes to the operation (e.g., different product sourcing, different customer focus), it's a *grey area*. It would depend on the specific facts and whether the ""activities"" are still considered ""fundamentally the same."" * **Unlikely TUPE (Scenario 3):** If the new butcher opens in the same premises, but operates a completely different type of business (e.g., a deli selling pre-prepared foods, not a traditional butcher shop), it's *unlikely* that TUPE would apply. **What Should Happen (If TUPE Applies)** If TUPE *does* apply: * **Automatic Transfer:** The employees of the old butcher (who were assigned to the ""organized grouping"" carrying out the butchery activities) would automatically transfer to the new butcher on their existing terms and conditions of employment. * **Information and Consultation:** The old butcher (or the administrator, in this case) and the new butcher have obligations to inform and consult with the affected employees (or their representatives) about the transfer. * **Liability:** The new butcher becomes responsible for all employment-related liabilities (e.g., unpaid wages, holiday pay). **What the Employees Should Do** The employees of the old butcher should: 1. **Seek Advice:** Contact ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) for free, impartial advice: [https://www.acas.org.uk/](https://www.acas.org.uk/). 2. **Contact a Trade Union:** If they are members of a trade union, they should contact their union representative. 3. **Contact a Solicitor:** If they believe TUPE applies and their rights are not being respected, they should seek legal advice from a solicitor specializing in employment law. 4. **Gather Information:** Collect any information they have about their employment (contracts, payslips, etc.) and the circumstances of the closure and the new business opening. **In summary, it's not simply about taking over premises in the same sector. It's about whether the *activities* carried out by the new business are ""fundamentally the same"" as those carried out by the old business. In the butcher shop example, it's quite possible that TUPE *would* apply, but it depends on the specific facts. The employees should seek advice from ACAS, a trade union, or a solicitor.** "	22.49864363670349	1		0		0	
Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	"You're going through a very difficult and emotional situation, and it's understandable that you're feeling a lot of hurt. You've built this business for over a decade, and external factors beyond your control have brought it to this point. It's also commendable that you've been proactive, communicative with HSBC, and are seeking advice. Many others have been through this, particularly after the pandemic and with the current economic challenges. Here's a breakdown of your situation, your options, and what to expect: **Key Points and Analysis** * **Limited Company:** You're operating as a limited company, which is important for limiting personal liability. * **Insolvent Company:** Your company is insolvent. You cannot pay your debts (the BBL) as they fall due, even with the payment holiday. * **Bounce Back Loan (BBL):** £12,000 outstanding. This is a company debt, *not* a personal one (assuming you didn't provide a personal guarantee, which is highly unlikely with a BBL). You used the BBL for legitimate business purposes (designing a new product and buying stock), which is important. * **HSBC's Position:** HSBC's supportive stance is positive. They've acknowledged your inability to pay and are not (at this point) pushing for formal insolvency proceedings. Their ""long term no affordability"" approach suggests they are willing to write off the debt, or at least a significant portion of it. * **No Other Creditors:** This simplifies the situation considerably. * **No Assets:** You've invested your own money, and the company has no remaining assets to sell. * **Heartbreak and Loss:** Your feelings of hurt and loss are completely valid. It's important to acknowledge these emotions and seek support if needed (from friends, family, or professional resources). * **""When do we strike the company off normally"":** This is your main question, and it's the right one to ask. **Options and the Likely Process** Given your situation (insolvent company, no assets, single creditor (HSBC) who is not pushing for liquidation), the most likely path is a **managed wind-down followed by a dissolution (striking off) application, with a high probability that HSBC will *not* object.** 1. **Formal Cessation of Trading:** If you haven't already done so, formally cease trading. Stop taking on new orders or incurring any new expenses. 2. **Communicate with HSBC (Formally):** Even though you've spoken to them, send a formal written communication (email is fine, keep a copy) to HSBC, stating: * The company has ceased trading due to [briefly explain the reasons: world events, cost of living crisis impacting demand for luxury goods]. * The company is insolvent and has no assets. * You are aware of the outstanding BBL and have been cooperating with HSBC. * You intend to apply to Companies House to dissolve the company (striking off). * Ask them to confirm in writing their ""long term no affordability"" approach and that they will *not* object to the striking-off application. This is crucial. Get it in writing. 3. **Prepare the DS01 Form:** Start preparing the DS01 form for striking off. You can find it on the Companies House website: [https://www.gov.uk/strike-off-your-company-from-companies-register](https://www.gov.uk/strike-off-your-company-from-companies-register) 4. **Wait for HSBC's Written Confirmation (Crucial):** *Do not* submit the DS01 form until you have received written confirmation from HSBC that they will not object to the striking off. This is the most important step to avoid complications. It might take a few weeks to get this confirmation. 5. **Submit the DS01 Form:** Once you have HSBC's written confirmation, submit the DS01 form to Companies House. You must declare on the form that you've notified all creditors (HSBC). 6. **Companies House Process:** * Companies House will publish a notice of your intended striking off in The Gazette (a public record). * Creditors (in this case, only HSBC) have a limited time (usually a few months) to object. * If there are no objections, the company will be struck off the register and dissolved. 7. **Final Accounts and Tax Returns:** Even though the company has ceased trading, you'll still need to file final accounts and tax returns with Companies House and HMRC. Your accountant can help with this. **Likely Outcome** Given HSBC's supportive approach and their statement that they won't pursue liquidation for a £12,000 BBL, it's *highly likely* that they will *not* object to the striking off, provided you follow the steps above and communicate with them formally. This means the company will likely be dissolved without the need for formal insolvency proceedings. **Important Considerations** * **Director's Duties:** Even though the company is insolvent, you still have duties as a director to act in the best interests of the creditors (in this case, HSBC). This means being transparent, cooperative, and not doing anything to worsen HSBC's position. * **Wrongful Trading:** You've already ceased trading, so wrongful trading (continuing to trade while knowing the company is insolvent and worsening the position of creditors) is not a concern. * **Personal Liability:** You have no personal guarantees, so your personal assets are protected. * **Future Directorships:** The striking off of the company *will* be on your record as a director, but it's unlikely to significantly impact your ability to be a director of other companies in the future, especially given the circumstances (global events, cost of living crisis). It's not the same as being disqualified for misconduct. * **Timeframe:** The entire process (from ceasing trading to dissolution) can take several months, mainly due to the waiting periods involved in the striking-off process. **What *Not* to Do** * **Don't Ignore the Situation:** Don't just walk away and hope the company will disappear. You need to follow the proper procedures. * **Don't Incur New Debts:** Don't take on any new liabilities on behalf of the company. * **Don't Use Company Funds Inappropriately:** Don't use any remaining company funds (if any) for personal expenses. **In summary, the most likely path for you is a managed wind-down followed by a dissolution (striking off) application. Communicate formally with HSBC, get their written confirmation that they won't object, and then proceed with the DS01 form. This will allow you to close down the company in an orderly and legally compliant way, without the need for expensive formal insolvency proceedings.** It's a difficult situation, but you're handling it responsibly.

Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	"This is a very difficult and emotionally charged situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling hurt, angry, and betrayed. You've been managing the business responsibly while your partner has been acting dishonestly and unprofessionally. It's good that you're seeking advice on the technical aspects of ending the partnership and protecting your interests. Here's a breakdown of the situation, your options, and potential pitfalls: **Key Issues and Analysis** * **General Partnership:** You're in a general partnership, which means you and your partner are *jointly and severally liable* for the partnership's debts. This is crucial to remember. * **Breach of Partnership Agreement:** Your partner has clearly breached several terms of your partnership agreement, specifically those relating to: * Handling cash. * Record keeping. * Paying in money. * Potentially, acting in good faith and in the best interests of the partnership. * **""Theft"" (or Misappropriation):** The £3,000 shortfall is effectively theft or misappropriation of partnership funds. While your partner calls it ""borrowing,"" their actions (taking money without your knowledge or consent, over a long period, and without proper accounting) meet the definition of theft. * **Loss of Trust:** This is the fundamental issue. You've lost trust in your partner, making it impossible to continue the partnership. * **Emotional Blackmail:** Your partner's use of their personal situation to manipulate you is unacceptable and unprofessional. * **Partnership Agreement:** The existence of a ""fairly thorough partnership agreement"" is *very* important. This document will govern how the partnership can be dissolved and what happens to the assets, liabilities, and goodwill. * **Expulsion Clause:** The fact that the agreement includes an expulsion clause is significant. This gives you a mechanism to remove your partner, but, as you correctly note, it will likely trigger the dissolution of the partnership. * **Goodwill and Intellectual Property:** These are valuable assets of the business, and the partnership agreement will likely address how they are dealt with upon dissolution. * **Desire to Continue the Business:** Your desire to continue the business alone is understandable, and it's often possible, but it requires careful planning and adherence to the partnership agreement. **Options and Potential Pitfalls** 1. **Expulsion and Dissolution (Most Likely Route):** * **Process:** Follow the *exact* procedure outlined in your partnership agreement for expulsion. This usually involves giving written notice, specifying the breaches of the agreement, and potentially allowing a period for remedy (which is unlikely to be successful in this case, given the nature of the breaches). * **Dissolution:** As you correctly surmised, expelling your partner in a two-person partnership will almost certainly trigger the dissolution of the partnership. The partnership agreement should outline the process for dissolution. * **Winding Up:** The partnership's affairs will need to be wound up. This involves: * Notifying customers and suppliers. * Collecting outstanding debts. * Paying off partnership liabilities. * Preparing final accounts. * Distributing any remaining assets according to the partnership agreement. * **Valuation:** The partnership assets (including stock, equipment, fixtures, and potentially goodwill) will need to be valued. You may need to get an independent valuation. * **Buyout:** You may need to buy out your partner's share of the partnership assets. The partnership agreement should specify how this is calculated. The £3,000 shortfall *must* be factored into this calculation. Your partner owes this money *back to the partnership*. * **Goodwill:** The partnership agreement should address goodwill. It may state that an expelled partner is not entitled to any share of the goodwill. If it's silent on this, goodwill will likely be considered a partnership asset and valued accordingly. * **Intellectual Property:** The partnership agreement should also address intellectual property (e.g., the business name, branding, any unique processes). If it's silent, it's generally considered a partnership asset. * **New Business:** Once the partnership is dissolved, you can set up a new business (sole trader, limited company, or new partnership) to continue the retail shop. You can use the same name and branding *if* the partnership agreement allows it or if you purchase those rights from the dissolved partnership. * **Potential Pitfalls:** * **Disputes over Valuation:** Your partner may dispute the valuation of the assets, including goodwill. * **Refusal to Cooperate:** Your partner may refuse to cooperate with the winding-up process. * **Legal Action:** Your partner could potentially take legal action to challenge the expulsion or the valuation. * **Tax Implications:** There are tax implications to dissolving a partnership and starting a new business. You'll need to consult with an accountant. 2. **Negotiated Dissolution (Less Likely, but Worth Considering):** * **Process:** Try to negotiate a mutually agreeable dissolution with your partner. This would involve agreeing on the terms of the separation, including the valuation of assets, the handling of liabilities, and the future of the business. * **Pros:** Potentially quicker, less expensive, and less acrimonious than expulsion. * **Cons:** Unlikely to be successful, given your partner's behavior and the loss of trust. They may be unwilling to agree to reasonable terms. * **Document everything**: Put everything in writing. 3. **Mediation (A Possible Step Before Expulsion):** * **Process:** Engage a neutral mediator to help you and your partner reach an agreement. * **Pros:** Can help facilitate communication and resolve disputes in a less adversarial way. * **Cons:** Requires both parties to be willing to participate and compromise. **Action Plan** 1. **Seek Legal Advice (Urgently):** Consult a solicitor who specializes in partnership law. They can: * Review your partnership agreement. * Advise you on the best course of action (expulsion or negotiated dissolution). * Help you draft the necessary notices and documents. * Negotiate with your partner (or their solicitor) on your behalf. * Represent you in any legal proceedings. 2. **Review the Partnership Agreement (Thoroughly):** Read the partnership agreement carefully, paying particular attention to the clauses on: * Expulsion. * Dissolution. * Valuation of assets. * Goodwill. * Intellectual property. * Dispute resolution. 3. **Document Everything:** Keep meticulous records of all communications with your partner, all financial transactions, and all steps taken in the dissolution process. 4. **Accountant:** Consult with your *new* accountant about the tax implications of dissolving the partnership and setting up a new business. 5. **Consider Reporting the Theft:** While you may be hesitant to do so, given your partner's personal situation, you should consider reporting the £3,000 theft to the police. This is a criminal offense. It also creates a formal record of the wrongdoing, which could be helpful in any legal disputes. 6. **Prioritise your own mental health.** **Reassurance** You are doing the right thing by seeking advice and taking steps to protect your interests. You are not responsible for your partner's actions or their personal situation. You have a right to end the partnership and to continue the business on your own, provided you follow the correct legal procedures. While it's a stressful and difficult situation, it's also an opportunity to rebuild the business on a more solid foundation. With the right legal and financial advice, you can navigate this process successfully. "	22.574827432632446	1	"[[""Does the lawyer encourage the petitioner to look at the partnership agreement?

Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	"Okay, this is a manageable situation, and it's good you're being proactive about closing things down properly. You're essentially describing a solvent liquidation (or a managed wind-down leading to dissolution), but with very limited funds. The key here is to understand creditor priority and to communicate transparently. Here's a breakdown: **Key Points:** * **Limited Company:** You're operating as a limited company, which protects your personal assets (except for the director's loan, which we'll address). * **Solvent (Technically):** You say you have ""no debt"" *except* the director's loan and the upcoming utility bills. The fact that you can't pay those utility bills *as they fall due* actually means the company is, technically, insolvent. However, the amounts are relatively small, and the situation is manageable. * **Ceased Trading:** You've stopped trading, which is the correct first step. * **Vacated Premises:** You've vacated the premises, and your landlord is (thankfully) understanding. * **£600 Remaining:** This is your only remaining company asset. * **Director's Loan:** The couple of thousand you've loaned to the company is an *unsecured debt*. This is important for prioritizing payments. * **Utility Bills:** Energy, water, and broadband are all *unsecured debts*. **Creditor Priority (Crucial)** In any winding-up situation, creditors are paid in a specific order of priority. Here's the simplified order that applies to your situation: 1. **Costs of winding down the business.** The costs to close a business. 2. **Preferential Creditors:** In your case, with no employees, there are *likely* no preferential creditors. Some specific HMRC debts *could* be preferential, but this is unlikely with a small, recently closed business. Corporation tax and VAT are generally *unsecured*. 3. **Unsecured Creditors:** This is where *all* your remaining debts fall: * Energy bill * Water bill * Broadband bill * Director's loan (money you loaned to the company) **Who to Prioritize (Pro-Rata Distribution)** Because all your remaining debts are *unsecured*, and you don't have enough funds to pay them all in full, you must distribute the £600 *pro-rata*. This means paying each creditor a proportion of what they are owed, based on the total amount owed to all unsecured creditors. **Example:** Let's say (these are just examples, you need the actual figures): * Energy Bill: £500 * Water Bill: £100 * Broadband Bill: £100 * Director's Loan: £2000 * **Total Unsecured Debts:** £2700 You have £600 available. 1. **Calculate the Percentage:** Divide the available funds (£600) by the total unsecured debts (£2700): £600 / £2700 = 0.222 (approximately 22.2%) 2. **Apply the Percentage:** Multiply each creditor's debt by the percentage (0.222) to determine how much they should receive: * Energy: £500 x 0.222 = £111 * Water: £100 x 0.222 = £22.20 * Broadband: £100 x 0.222 = £22.20 * Director's Loan: £2000 x 0.222 = £444 (This is money *you* are owed, so you effectively write this off, as you can't, practically, pay yourself from the remaining funds) 3. **Pay the Creditors:** Pay the energy, water, and broadband providers the calculated amounts. **What Happens When They Chase for the Remainder?** * **They Will Chase:** The utility companies will almost certainly chase you (or rather, the company) for the remaining unpaid amounts. * **Respond in Writing:** When they chase, respond *in writing* (email is fine, keep copies). Explain: * The company has ceased trading. * The company is insolvent and has no assets. * You have distributed the remaining funds pro-rata to all unsecured creditors. * You are in the process of applying to Companies House to dissolve the company (striking off). * **They Might Object (but unlikely):** The utility companies *could* object to the striking off. However, given the small amounts involved, it's unlikely they'll go to the expense of formal insolvency proceedings. * **No Personal Liability:** Because these are company debts, and you haven't provided personal guarantees, you are *not* personally liable for the unpaid amounts. The utility companies cannot pursue you personally. The exception is the director's loan, but that's money you owe *to* the company, not the other way around. You've essentially lost that money. **Action Plan** 1. **Calculate Exact Debts:** Get the exact figures for the outstanding energy, water, and broadband bills. 2. **Calculate Pro-Rata Distribution:** Use the method described above to calculate how much to pay each creditor. 3. **Pay the Creditors:** Pay the calculated amounts to the utility companies. 4. **Respond to Chasing Letters:** Respond in writing to any chasing letters, explaining the situation (ceased trading, insolvency, pro-rata distribution, striking off). 5. **Apply for Striking Off (DS01):** Once you've paid the creditors and dealt with any initial chasing, apply to Companies House to dissolve the company (Form DS01). You must declare that you've notified all creditors. 6. File final accounts. **Important Considerations** * **Director's Loan:** You will not recover the money you loaned to the company. This is a loss. * **Striking Off:** The striking-off process can take several months. * **Future Directorships:** The striking off will be on your record as a director, but it's unlikely to significantly impact your ability to be a director of other companies in the future, given the circumstances. **In summary, you need to distribute the remaining £600 pro-rata to your unsecured creditors (energy, water, broadband). Respond to any chasing letters in writing, explaining the situation. Then, proceed with the Companies House striking-off application. You are not personally liable for the remaining unpaid company debts.** "	19.746744394302368	1	"[[""Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?
