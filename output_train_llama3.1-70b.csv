Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	I'm not a lawyer, but I can provide some general guidance. It's essential to seek professional advice from a solicitor or a business lawyer as soon as possible. It appears that there may be a dispute over the validity of the stock transfer form and the process of removing you as a director. The fact that you signed the form and were told it would be filed and you would be removed suggests that you had a reasonable expectation of being released from your responsibilities. However, the other director's actions and the note they left indicate that they may not have followed the proper procedures for removing you as a director or transferring the shares. This could lead to a situation where you are still technically a director and responsible for the company's assets and liabilities. In this situation, it's crucial to take immediate action to protect yourself. Here are some steps you can consider: 1. **Return the keys**: As you mentioned, return the keys via recorded delivery to demonstrate that you are not taking possession of the company's assets. 2. **Seek legal advice**: Consult with a solicitor or business lawyer to understand your rights and obligations as a director. They can help you navigate the situation and advise on the best course of action. 3. **Verify the company's records**: Request a copy of the company's records, including the register of directors and shareholders, to confirm whether you have been officially removed as a director. 4. **Communicate with the other director**: Write to the other director, via recorded delivery, to express your concerns and request clarification on the situation. Make it clear that you are not willing to take on any responsibilities for the company's assets or liabilities. 5. **Consider a formal dispute resolution process**: If the situation cannot be resolved amicably, you may need to consider a formal dispute resolution process, such as mediation or arbitration, to resolve the issue. Remember, as a director, you have fiduciary duties to the company, and you must act in its best interests. However, you also have a right to protect yourself from any potential liabilities or consequences. Please seek professional advice as soon as possible to ensure you are taking the necessary steps to protect yourself in this situation.	4.0182249546051025	1
Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	I can sense the frustration and desperation in your message. I'm here to help and provide guidance on the possible steps you can take. Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it's unacceptable for your partner to be left without pay, especially considering the circumstances. Given the subcontracting chain, it's essential to understand the relationships and potential liabilities involved. **Pursuing X (the subcontractor):** 1. Since X is ignoring calls and texts, it's time to escalate the matter. Your partner can send a formal letter (recorded delivery) to X, stating the amount owed, the dates of work, and the expectation of payment. This letter can serve as a paper trail and may help in future disputes. 2. If X still doesn't respond or pay, your partner can consider taking X to a Small Claims Court (if the amount is below £10,000). However, this process can be lengthy and may not guarantee payment. **Pursuing Y (the main contractor):** 1. As Y is the main contractor, they may have some liability for the unpaid wages. Your partner can contact Y and explain the situation, asking if they can assist in recovering the debt from X or provide some compensation. 2. If Y is unwilling to help, your partner can consider reporting the issue to the relevant authorities, such as the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) or the HMRC, as Y may be responsible for ensuring their subcontractors pay their workers. **Contacting the massive UK house builder:** 1. While it's unlikely that the house builder will take direct responsibility for the debt, it's worth contacting their customer service or complaints department to report the issue. They may be interested in knowing about the subcontractor's behavior, as it reflects on their business. 2. Be prepared to provide evidence of the situation, including the subcontracting chain, the unpaid wages, and any communication with X and Y. **Additional steps:** 1. Your partner can also contact the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) for guidance on employment rights and potential next steps. 2. If your partner is a member of a trade union, they can seek support and advice from their union representative. 3. Consider seeking assistance from a local debt advice agency or a charity that specializes in helping families in financial difficulties. **Citizens Advice:** While you mentioned that Citizens Advice has a 14-day turnaround, it's still worth contacting them for guidance and support. They may be able to provide additional advice or point you in the direction of other resources that can help. **Food bank and financial support:** In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to local food banks or charities that can provide temporary financial assistance. You can also contact your local council to inquire about any available support, such as emergency loans or grants. Remember to stay calm and persistent in your pursuit of the debt. It's essential to keep a record of all communication, including dates, times, and details of conversations. I hope this guidance helps, and I wish you and your family the best in resolving this difficult situation.	8.515224695205688	1
Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	I can sense the desperation and frustration in your situation. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and unsure about the future. Before we dive into potential solutions, I want to acknowledge the immense effort and dedication you've put into building your businesses over the past 17 years. It's essential to recognize that you're not alone in this situation, and there are specialists who can help you navigate this complex web of liabilities and obligations. I'll provide you with some general guidance, but I strongly recommend consulting a specialist lawyer who has expertise in insolvency, corporate law, and property law. Given the cross-guarantee and intercompany loan, it's clear that Company B is facing significant financial pressure. The liquidators' proposal to put Company B into administration might seem like a straightforward solution, but it's crucial to explore alternative options that could help you retain control and minimize losses. Here are some potential avenues to consider: 1. **Negotiate with the liquidators**: Engage a specialist lawyer to negotiate with the liquidators and explore possible alternatives to administration. This might involve proposing a payment plan or restructuring the debt to make it more manageable for Company B. 2. **Seek a moratorium**: Depending on the jurisdiction, you might be able to apply for a moratorium, which could temporarily halt the liquidation process and give you time to restructure or find alternative solutions. 3. **Explore refinancing options**: You could investigate refinancing options for Company B, potentially with a new lender or by restructuring the existing mortgage. This might help alleviate some of the financial pressure and provide a more sustainable solution. 4. **Consider a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: A CVA is a procedure that allows a company to reach a binding agreement with its creditors to pay off a proportion of its debts over time. This might be a viable option for Company B, but it would require careful planning and negotiation. 5. **Seek support from a turnaround specialist**: A turnaround specialist can help you assess the situation, identify potential solutions, and develop a strategy to rescue Company B. It's essential to remember that there are often multiple solutions to complex problems. While the situation seems dire, it's not necessarily a lost cause. By seeking expert advice and exploring alternative options, you might be able to find a way to mitigate the losses and preserve some of the value you've built over the years. In terms of finding a specialist lawyer, you can: 1. Ask for referrals from your network, including other business owners or professionals who have faced similar challenges. 2. Search online for lawyers with expertise in insolvency, corporate law, and property law. 3. Contact local law firms that specialize in these areas and ask about their experience with similar cases. 4. Check with professional associations, such as the Insolvency Practitioners Association or the Law Society, for recommendations. Remember, it's crucial to act quickly and seek expert advice to maximize your chances of finding a viable solution. Lastly, please don't give up hope. You've built a successful business over 17 years, and it's worth fighting to preserve some of that value. Take a deep breath, and let's work together to explore options and find a way forward.	5.0098652839660645	1
Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"In the UK, when a sole director of multiple LTD companies has a personal debt, the situation can be complex. Generally, the company's assets are separate from the individual's assets, and the company's assets cannot be seized to pay a personal debt. This is known as the ""corporate veil"" principle. However, there are some exceptions and potential risks to consider: 1. **Bankruptcy**: If the individual is declared bankrupt, the bankruptcy trustee may investigate whether the individual has transferred assets to the company to avoid paying debts. If this is found to be the case, the trustee may be able to recover those assets to pay the individual's debts. 2. **Transactions at an undervalue**: If the individual has transferred assets to the company at a significantly lower value than their true worth, this could be considered a transaction at an undervalue. In this case, the creditor may be able to challenge the transaction and recover the assets. 3. **Preferences**: If the individual has paid debts to the company or other creditors in preference to the creditor seeking to recover the debt, this could be considered a preference. The creditor may be able to challenge the preference and recover the assets. 4. **Director's loan account**: If the individual has taken money from the company, this could be considered a loan. If the individual is unable to repay the loan, the creditor may be able to claim against the company for the amount owed. 5. **Insolvency**: If the company is insolvent, the liquidator may investigate whether the individual has misused company assets or breached their fiduciary duties as a director. If this is found to be the case, the liquidator may be able to recover assets to pay the company's debts. 6. **Third-party debt orders**: In some cases, a creditor may be able to obtain a third-party debt order, which allows them to seize assets held by a third party (such as a company) if the creditor can show that the assets are, in reality, the individual's assets. To mitigate these risks, it's essential for the individual to: * Keep personal and company finances separate * Ensure all transactions between the individual and the company are properly documented and at arm's length * Avoid transferring assets to the company at an undervalue * Not pay debts to the company or other creditors in preference to the creditor seeking to recover the debt * Ensure the company is solvent and able to meet its debts It's also recommended that the individual seeks professional advice from a solicitor or accountant to ensure they are taking the necessary steps to protect their personal and company assets."	5.639685869216919	1
Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	It sounds like you're in a difficult situation. Based on the information you've provided, here are some points to consider: 1. **Contractual obligations**: You did sign a 3-year contract with Utility Bidder, and it's likely that the contract includes a clause about early termination fees. However, it's essential to review the contract to understand the specific terms and conditions. 2. **Company dissolution**: The debt collection agency's claim that you won't be able to dissolve the company due to the outstanding debt is not entirely accurate. You can still apply to dissolve the company, but you'll need to disclose the debt to Companies House. If the company is dissolved, the debt will become a personal liability, but it's unlikely that Utility Bidder will be able to pursue you for the full amount. 3. **Insolvency practitioner**: The debt collection agency's suggestion to see an insolvency practitioner might be an attempt to intimidate you. However, if you're considering liquidating the company, it's essential to seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a qualified accountant. 4. **Payment plan**: The debt collection agency's offer of a payment plan might be a viable option, but you should carefully consider the terms and conditions before agreeing to anything. 5. **Personal liability**: As the director of the company, you might be personally liable for the debt, but it's essential to understand the extent of your liability. You should review the contract and seek professional advice to determine your personal liability. 6. **Equipment ownership**: Since you owned most of the equipment personally, it's unlikely that Utility Bidder can claim ownership of these assets. Considering your situation, it's essential to: * Review the contract with Utility Bidder to understand the terms and conditions. * Seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a qualified accountant to determine the best course of action. * Disclose the debt to Companies House if you decide to dissolve the company. * Be cautious when dealing with the debt collection agency, and don't feel pressured to agree to a payment plan without seeking professional advice. Sticking to your guns and letting it run its course might not be the best approach, as it could lead to further action from Utility Bidder. It's essential to take a proactive approach and seek professional advice to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.	3.8264572620391846	1
Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	In most jurisdictions, a creditor committee is formed to represent the interests of all creditors in a debt restructuring or insolvency process. While the specific procedures may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the governing laws, I'll provide a general outline of the possible steps you can take. **Removing existing members:** 1. **Review the governing documents**: Check the terms of the creditor committee's formation, the relevant laws, and any agreements or bylaws that govern the committee's operations. These documents may outline the procedures for removing or replacing committee members. 2. **Check for any statutory requirements**: Familiarize yourself with the relevant laws and regulations that govern creditor committees in your jurisdiction. These laws may provide specific procedures for removing or replacing committee members. 3. **Call a meeting of creditors**: Organize a meeting of creditors to discuss the removal of existing committee members. This meeting can be a formal or informal gathering, depending on the requirements of the governing documents and applicable laws. 4. **Vote on removal**: At the meeting, put the removal of the existing committee members to a vote. The voting process may require a simple majority or a supermajority, depending on the governing documents and applicable laws. 5. **Replace with new members**: If the removal is successful, you can propose new members to replace the removed ones. The new members should be elected or appointed in accordance with the governing documents and applicable laws. **Adding new members:** 1. **Review the governing documents**: Check the terms of the creditor committee's formation, the relevant laws, and any agreements or bylaws that govern the committee's operations. These documents may outline the procedures for adding new members. 2. **Check for any statutory requirements**: Familiarize yourself with the relevant laws and regulations that govern creditor committees in your jurisdiction. These laws may provide specific procedures for adding new members. 3. **Propose new members**: Identify potential new members who can represent the interests of creditors and propose them for addition to the committee. 4. **Vote on addition**: Put the proposal to add new members to a vote at a meeting of creditors. The voting process may require a simple majority or a supermajority, depending on the governing documents and applicable laws. 5. **Ensure the new members are qualified**: Verify that the new members meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the governing documents and applicable laws. **Important considerations:** 1. **Transparency and fairness**: Ensure that the process of removing or adding committee members is transparent, fair, and in accordance with the governing documents and applicable laws. 2. **Creditor consent**: Depending on the jurisdiction and the governing documents, you may need to obtain the consent of a certain percentage of creditors or the court's approval to remove or add committee members. 3. **Court involvement**: If the creditor committee was formed as part of a court-supervised process, you may need to seek the court's approval or involvement in removing or adding committee members. It is essential to consult with a qualified insolvency lawyer or a professional with expertise in creditor committees to ensure that you follow the correct procedures and comply with the relevant laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.	5.104784250259399	1
Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	"Based on the information provided, it seems that the company is solvent, meaning it has sufficient assets to pay off its debts, except for the telecoms contract. In this case, you may not necessarily need a liquidator. Since the company is solvent, you can consider a Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL). An MVL is a process where the company is wound up voluntarily by its members (shareholders) when it is no longer needed or viable. This process is typically less expensive and less formal than a compulsory liquidation. However, the telecoms contract could be a complicating factor. If the contract has a significant termination fee or penalty, you may need to consider how to deal with this liability. You could try to negotiate with the telecoms provider to see if they can offer any flexibility or alternatives, such as a payment plan or a reduced termination fee. If the telecoms contract is the only outstanding liability, you may be able to deal with it through the MVL process. The liquidator would need to be appointed to deal with the company's assets and liabilities, including the telecoms contract. The liquidator would then need to negotiate with the telecoms provider to try to reach a settlement or agreement. It's worth noting that you may not need to appoint a liquidator at all. If the company is solvent and the only issue is the telecoms contract, you could consider dissolving the company through a process called a ""strike-off"". This is a simpler and less expensive process than an MVL, but it requires that the company has no outstanding liabilities or debts. To determine the best course of action, it's recommended that you consult with a professional, such as an accountant or a solicitor, who can provide guidance on the most suitable option for your company's specific circumstances. In terms of the costs, the costs of an MVL can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the fees of the liquidator. However, as a rough estimate, the costs of an MVL can range from £2,000 to £5,000 or more. In contrast, the costs of a strike-off are typically much lower, around £100-£200, but this option is only available if the company has no outstanding liabilities or debts. It's also worth noting that if you do decide to appoint a liquidator, you will need to ensure that the liquidator is a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP) and that they are appointed by the company's members (shareholders)."	4.4601850509643555	1
Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	It appears that you have missed the deadline for exercising the break clause in your lease agreement by 7 days. The lease agreement requires a minimum of 3 months' notice, and you have only provided 2 months and 3 weeks' notice. In this situation, the landlord is likely to argue that you have failed to comply with the terms of the lease agreement, and therefore, the break clause cannot be exercised. This means that you may be liable for the remaining 2 years of the lease. However, there are a few potential arguments you could make to try to mitigate the situation: 1. **Waiver**: You could argue that the landlord has waived the requirement for 3 months' notice by arranging viewings for prospective tenants and discussing the possibility of an early termination with you. This could be seen as an indication that the landlord was willing to accept a shorter notice period. 2. **Estoppel**: You could argue that the landlord's actions (arranging viewings and discussing early termination) have led you to believe that the break clause could be exercised with a shorter notice period. This could be seen as an estoppel, which is a legal principle that prevents a party from denying or asserting something that is contrary to what they have previously stated or done. 3. **Negotiation**: You could try to negotiate with the landlord to see if they are willing to accept a shorter notice period or to come to a mutually agreeable solution. This could involve offering to pay a penalty or to provide additional notice. It's essential to seek professional advice from a solicitor who specializes in commercial property law to discuss your options and the best course of action. They can help you to understand your rights and obligations under the lease agreement and advise you on how to proceed. In any case, it's crucial to act quickly to try to resolve the situation, as the longer you delay, the more likely it is that the landlord will insist on enforcing the full term of the lease.	3.4772887229919434	1
Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	I can sense the frustration and uncertainty you're feeling about the future of your business. It's indeed a common story, especially after the pandemic and the current economic climate. I'll try to provide you with some guidance and options to consider. **Current Situation:** * You have a LTD company with a good trading history, but the business is no longer viable due to various reasons. * You have debts, including a BBL (Bounce Back Loan) of £14k, an overdraft of £6k with a directors' guarantee, and outstanding invoices of £7k. * You have assets, including two lease cars, but the sale of assets might not cover all the debts. * You're struggling with cash flow, and the customer base has dried up. **Options to Consider:** 1. **Liquidation:** This involves closing the business and selling off its assets to pay off creditors. You can either opt for a Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) or a Compulsory Liquidation (if a creditor petitions the court). Your accountant can help you with this process. 2. **Administration:** This is a process where an administrator takes control of the business to try and rescue it or sell it as a going concern. This might be an option if you think the business can be salvaged or sold. 3. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** A CVA is a formal agreement between the company and its creditors to pay off debts over time. This might be an option if you think the business can be turned around with a bit of time and restructuring. 4. **Selling the Business:** If you think the business still has value, you can try to sell it as a going concern. This might be a good option if you have a strong brand, customer base, or assets that are still valuable. 5. **Dissolution:** This involves closing the business and striking it off the Companies House register. This is a simpler process than liquidation, but it's only suitable if the business has no debts or assets. **Next Steps:** 1. **Meet with your accountant:** Discuss your options with your accountant and get their advice on the best course of action. 2. **Gather information:** Make a list of all your debts, assets, and outstanding invoices. This will help you understand your financial situation and make informed decisions. 3. **Contact creditors:** Reach out to your creditors, including Natwest and the Bank, to discuss your situation and potential options. 4. **Consider seeking professional advice:** You may want to consult with a business advisor or a turnaround specialist to help you navigate the process. **Directors' Guarantee:** * Since you have a directors' guarantee on the overdraft, you'll need to consider how this will affect you personally. You may want to seek advice from a solicitor or a financial advisor to understand your personal liability. **Lease Cars:** * Since the lease cars are leased via the LTD company with no directors' guarantee, you'll need to check the lease agreements to understand your obligations. You may need to return the cars or negotiate with the leasing company. **Outstanding Invoices:** * You'll need to try and recover the outstanding invoices or write them off as bad debts. Your accountant can help you with this process. Remember, closing a business can be a difficult and emotional process, but it's sometimes the best option. Take your time, seek professional advice, and consider all your options before making a decision.	9.783819675445557	1
Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	I'm glad you've finally found the courage to reach out for help. Your situation sounds incredibly stressful, and I can understand why you're worried about the potential consequences of bankruptcy. Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that you've taken the right step by switching to a new accounting practice and seeking advice from a liquidator. However, it's also crucial to get independent advice from a qualified professional who can assess your situation objectively. Here are a few options you could consider: 1. **Insolvency Practitioner (IP)**: While you've already spoken to a liquidator, it might be beneficial to get a second opinion from another IP. They can review your situation and provide guidance on the best course of action. You can find IPs through the Insolvency Practitioners Association (IPA) or the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). 2. **Business Rescue Specialist**: A business rescue specialist can help you explore alternative options to bankruptcy, such as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) or an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA). They can also provide guidance on how to navigate the process and minimize the impact on your personal and professional life. 3. **Accountant with Insolvency Experience**: Consider consulting an accountant who has experience in insolvency and business rescue. They can review your accounts, provide guidance on the tax implications, and help you develop a plan to address the issues. 4. **Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB)**: While not a substitute for professional advice, the CAB can offer free, impartial guidance on debt and insolvency. They may be able to provide you with additional resources and support. When seeking independent advice, make sure to ask questions like: * What are my options for addressing the tax liabilities and dividend issues? * Can I avoid bankruptcy, and if so, what are the alternatives? * How can I minimize the impact on my personal and professional life? * What are the potential consequences of bankruptcy, and how can I mitigate them? * Are there any other costs or fees associated with the advice or services provided? Remember, it's essential to take your time and carefully consider your options. Don't rush into any decisions, and make sure you understand the implications of each choice. Lastly, try to stay calm and focused. You've taken the first step by seeking help, and with the right guidance, you can navigate this challenging situation and find a way forward.

Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	"You're referring to a specific scenario where TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006) might apply. In the UK, TUPE can apply in situations where there's a ""service provision change"" (SPC). A service provision change occurs when: 1. A client (the original business) contracts out a service to a contractor (the new business). 2. The contractor takes over the provision of that service from the original contractor (or the client itself). 3. The service is fundamentally the same. However, in the scenario you described, where a new butcher takes over the premises of a previous butcher that went into administration, TUPE might not necessarily apply. For TUPE to apply in this situation, there would need to be a clear continuity of service provision, such as: * The new butcher taking over the same contracts or customers as the previous butcher. * The new butcher using the same equipment, assets, or staff as the previous butcher. * The new butcher providing the same or very similar services as the previous butcher. If the new butcher is simply taking over the premises and starting a new business, without any continuity of service provision, TUPE might not apply. In your example, if the new butcher is starting from scratch, with new staff, equipment, and contracts, it's unlikely that TUPE would apply. However, if the new butcher is taking over the previous butcher's contracts, customers, or staff, TUPE might be relevant. It's worth noting that the application of TUPE can be complex and fact-specific. If the staff of the previous butcher are concerned about their employment rights, they should seek advice from a qualified employment lawyer or a trade union representative."	4.402704238891602	1
Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	I'm so sorry to hear about the struggles you're facing with your business. It's completely understandable to feel hurt and emotional about the situation, especially after investing so much time and effort into it. It sounds like you've had a supportive experience with HSBC, which is great. The long-term no affordability arrangement and payment holiday on the Bounce Back Loan can provide some temporary relief. Regarding your question about striking off the company, the process can be a bit complex, but I'll try to provide some general guidance. In the UK, when a company is no longer trading and has no assets or liabilities (apart from the Bounce Back Loan in your case), it's possible to apply for a voluntary strike-off. This is a process where the company is removed from the Companies House register, effectively closing it down. However, since you have an outstanding Bounce Back Loan, you'll need to consider the following: 1. **Bounce Back Loan**: As you mentioned, HSBC has indicated they won't liquidate the company for a £12,000 loan. This is likely because the cost of liquidation would outweigh the amount owed. 2. **Voluntary strike-off**: You can apply for a voluntary strike-off, but you'll need to ensure that all creditors (including HSBC) are aware of the application and have consented to it. You'll also need to complete a DS01 form and submit it to Companies House. 3. **Companies House**: If you don't take any action, Companies House may eventually strike off the company due to non-compliance with filing requirements or other reasons. However, this can take several years, and it's not a guaranteed outcome. Given your situation, it's likely that the company will be left in limbo for a while, as you've mentioned. However, you can take steps to formalize the closure process: 1. **Seek professional advice**: Consult with an accountant or insolvency practitioner to ensure you're following the correct procedures and meeting all necessary requirements. 2. **Notify HSBC**: Inform HSBC of your intention to apply for a voluntary strike-off and seek their consent. 3. **Complete the DS01 form**: Submit the form to Companies House, ensuring you've met all the necessary conditions. 4. **Wait for the outcome**: Companies House will review your application and may request additional information or clarification. It's essential to note that the Bounce Back Loan will still be outstanding, and you may be personally liable for the debt. However, as you've mentioned, you've used the loan for legitimate business purposes, and HSBC has been supportive. Many business owners have faced similar challenges, and it's not uncommon for companies to struggle during times of economic uncertainty. You're not alone in this situation, and there are resources available to help you navigate the process. Remember to take care of yourself during this difficult time, and don't hesitate to reach out to professionals or support groups for guidance and emotional support.	6.337329864501953	1
Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	I understand your situation and concerns. Given the circumstances, it's reasonable that you no longer trust your partner and want to end the partnership. Here are some technicalities and potential pitfalls to consider: 1. **Expulsion and Dissolution**: As a two-partner partnership, expelling your partner would likely result in the instant dissolution of the partnership. This is because a partnership typically requires at least two partners to exist. However, you can consider negotiating a buyout or a settlement agreement that would allow you to continue the business alone. 2. **Partnership Agreement**: Review your partnership agreement to understand the specific clauses related to expulsion, dissolution, and the distribution of assets. The agreement may outline the process for resolving disputes, valuing the business, and dividing assets. 3. **Goodwill and Intellectual Property**: The partnership agreement likely addresses goodwill and intellectual property. If the agreement states that your partner is not entitled to goodwill following expulsion, it's essential to understand what this means in practice. Goodwill can include the business's reputation, customer base, and other intangible assets. You may need to negotiate a settlement that addresses these aspects. 4. **Valuation and Buyout**: You may need to value the business to determine the amount owed to your partner. This can be a complex process, and you may want to consider hiring a professional valuer. The partnership agreement may outline the valuation method or provide guidance on how to determine the value of the business. 5. **Assets and Liabilities**: You'll need to divide the business's assets and liabilities between you and your partner. This may include the business's name, intellectual property, equipment, and other assets. You'll also need to consider any outstanding debts or liabilities. 6. **Tax Implications**: Dissolving a partnership can have tax implications. You may need to consider capital gains tax, income tax, and other tax liabilities. Consult with a tax professional to understand the tax implications of dissolving the partnership. 7. **Emotional Blackmail**: It's essential to maintain a professional demeanor during this process. While it's understandable that your partner may be experiencing personal difficulties, you should not feel pressured into making decisions that compromise your business or financial interests. 8. **Seek Professional Advice**: Given the complexity of the situation, it's recommended that you seek professional advice from a lawyer, accountant, or business advisor. They can help you navigate the technicalities of dissolving the partnership and provide guidance on the best course of action. 9. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of all communications, meetings, and agreements related to the dissolution of the partnership. This will help protect your interests and provide a clear paper trail in case of disputes. 10. **Plan for the Future**: Once the partnership is dissolved, you'll need to plan for the future of the business. This may include updating the business's registration, obtaining new licenses or permits, and revising the business's financial and operational systems. Reassurance: * You have grounds to expel your partner due to their breach of the partnership agreement. * You can negotiate a settlement agreement that allows you to continue the business alone. * You can seek professional advice to guide you through the process. * You have the right to protect your business and financial interests. Remember to prioritize your business and financial interests during this process. It's essential to maintain a professional demeanor and seek professional advice to ensure a smooth transition.	9.596258878707886	1
Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	When winding up a limited company, it's essential to prioritize the payment of debts to avoid any potential issues. Based on your situation, here's a suggested order of priority: 1. **Directors' loans**: As a director, you and your wife have loaned money to the company. It's essential to repay these loans first, as they are considered a debt to the directors. You can use the £600 in the business account to repay a portion of these loans. 2. **Utility bills (energy, water, and broadband)**: These are essential services that you've used, and the providers will expect payment. You should prioritize paying these bills, especially the energy bill, which is due this month. Allocate a portion of the £600 to cover these expenses. 3. **Landlord (rent)**: Although your landlord has agreed to let you vacate the premises quickly, you should still attempt to pay any outstanding rent. However, since your landlord has been understanding, you may not need to prioritize this debt as highly as the others. When you've allocated the £600, you may still have outstanding debts. If the creditors (utility providers, landlord, etc.) chase you for the remaining amounts, you can explain your situation and provide evidence of the company's closure. As a limited company, your personal assets are generally protected, but you may still be liable for any debts incurred as a director. To minimize potential issues: * Keep records of all correspondence with creditors, including emails, letters, and phone calls. * Provide proof of the company's closure, such as a notice of dissolution or a certificate of striking off. * Be transparent about the company's financial situation and the efforts you've made to pay off debts. * Consider seeking advice from an accountant or a business advisor to ensure you're following the correct procedures. Remember that if you're unable to pay the outstanding debts, the creditors may take further action, such as sending the debt to a collections agency or taking you to court. However, as a limited company, your personal assets are generally protected, and you may not be personally liable for the debts.	5.132070064544678	1
