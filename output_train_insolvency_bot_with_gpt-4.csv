0	Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	"Based on the circumstances you provided, it’s important to firstly understand that just signing a stock transfer form does not necessarily remove you as a director of the company. To officially resign as a director, you would've had to submit Form TM01 to Companies House. As you mentioned that you ""assumed"" you had been taken off the business, it's important to clarify whether this process was actually completed. You can check the current directors of the company on Companies House’s website. If you are still listed as a director, you have legal responsibilities, potential liabilities and the right to act in certain ways in relation to the company, despite your disagreement with the other director. Regarding the debts of the company, if it is insolvent (cannot pay its debts as they fall due), based on the case law such as Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 and Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch), and legislation such as the Insolvency Act 1986, you must act in the best interests of the company’s creditors as a whole to minimize potential loss to them. This may include selling assets and paying off debts. You may need to seek professional advice (such as from an insolvency practitioner) as this process can be complex and failure to fulfil your duties can lead to legal consequences. It's also important not to dispose of company assets at undervalue or make preferential payments to certain creditors, which could be challenged under the Insolvency Act 1986. As the situation is quite complicated, it's strongly advised that you seek professional legal advice as soon as possible, given the implications of director’s duties and potential insolvency of the company. Please note that this advice is general in nature and may not be applicable to your specific circumstances."	34.74743604660034	1	Companies Act 2006 section 1003|Insolvency Act 1986 section 234|Insolvency Act 1986 section 371	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)|H.R.

1	Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	I’m truly sorry to hear about your current predicament. This is indeed a complex situation. Due to the complexity, it's advised to consult with a legal professional, and also consider the steps below. 1. **Communicate:** Continue trying to communicate with person X and Y to resolve the matter. 2. **Document Everything:** Maintain records of all communication, and work done to show there's indeed an outstanding debt. This may be crucial in legal proceedings. 3. **Speak to Employer Y and Builder:** While it might seem unlikely either the employer Y or the large house builder will do anything, sometimes bringing such issues to light may pressure the subcontractor to act, or they may assist in resolution in some other way. 4. **Legal Rout:** If the above steps aren't fruitful, you can consider legal action. You may be able to apply to court to have the company (your partner worked for) wound up if they owe more than £750 and refuse to pay. Refer to the Insolvency Act 1986, section 222. However, keep in mind this should be the last resort as it can be a costly and lengthy process. The infamous case of Salomon v Salomon & Co. has established the legal principle that a company is a separate legal entity from its shareholders. This means that normally, the debts of a company would not be the responsibility of its shareholders or its directors (unless they signed personal guarantees). However, in some exceptional circumstances, a process called 'piercing the corporate veil' can be used, like in the case of Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd and Gilford Motor Co. Ltd v Horne. This is typically used in cases where a company has been misused or abuse has taken place. This is a complicated area of law and typically it would be difficult to apply it to a simple case of non-payment. Remember, each situation is unique and what may have worked in previous legal cases may not apply directly to your situation. Legal counsel can provide advice tailored to your circumstances. Furthermore, consider reaching out to charities and support networks that can provide interim assistance during this difficult period. I wish you all the best in resolving this issue and improving your situation.	40.31560564041138	1	Companies Act 2006 section 591|Companies Act 2006 section 43|Insolvency Act 1986 section 222	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

2	Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	I'm sorry to hear about the difficult position you find yourself in. Please keep in mind that while I can provide some general legal insight, it's essential that you seek independent legal advice that considers your individual circumstances. From what you describe, it appears you're dealing with potential claims for intercompany loans and cross-guarantees, as well as the consideration of putting Company B into administration. Firstly, it's important to note the case of Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38, where the court upheld contractual provisions in a complex commercial transaction entered into in good faith, emphasizing the relevance of commercial sense and the absence of intent to evade insolvency laws. This may be applicable to your situation, assuming the intercompany loan and cross-guarantees were entered into in good faith and with sound commercial reasoning. The cases of HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch), Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch), and Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383, refer to the insolvency tests and the duties of directors when a company is insolvent or close to insolvency. If Company B is insolvent on either a cash-flow or balance-sheet test, then it's extremely important to act in the best interests of the creditors. A key consideration is whether putting Company B into administration would achieve a better result for the creditors as a whole than winding up the company which is noted under Section A16 of the Insolvency Act 1986. If this is likely to be the case, then administration would be the legally correct route to take, despite the consequences for the business or the property. Lastly, it is crucial to consider the impact of potential director disqualification for wrongful trading if you continue to trade whilst knowing there is no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation (Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986). Given the complexity of your situation, I strongly recommend you lay out all these circumstances with a specialist insolvency solicitor who can provide comprehensive advice tailored to your circumstances.	29.674326181411743	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 411|Insolvency Act 1986 section 95|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38|HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383|Eurofood IFSC ltd, Re [2006] Ch. 508 C-341/04 |Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form WU04|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM22|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form 600CH
3	Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"As a general rule, a director's personal liabilities do not extend to the companies they control. This is based on the well-established principle of corporate personality, as confirmed in the landmark case of Salomon v Salomon & Co [1897] AC 22. In this case, the court held that there is a legal distinction between a company and its members. Therefore, the individual's personal debts do not become the company's debts. Hence, personal creditors cannot seize the assets of a company to satisfy a debt owed by an individual, even if that individual is the sole director of the company. The company’s assets belong to the company, not to the directors or shareholders. However, there are certain circumstances where courts may ""pierce the corporate veil"" and hold directors personally liable for the company's debts, particularly in situations involving fraud, wrongful trading, or when the company is acting as the mere puppet of the director. For these circumstances to apply, specific legal procedures would need to be followed to establish such claims. For your circumstance involving personal debts, unless there is some evidence of improper behaviour or abuse of the corporate form, the company assets should not be at risk from a director's personal creditors. However, it's essential to seek personal legal advice tailored to your precise situation since these rules can vary depending on specific facts and circumstances."	24.84790277481079	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 373|Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 section 15|Companies Act 2006 section 1187	Salomon v Salomon & Co.

4	Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	"At the outset, I’d like to clarify that the advice provided is general in nature and may not cover all aspects of your specific situation. It’s always recommended that you consult with a practitioner for personalised advice. The pursuit for an outstanding debt by a debtor after you have applied to dissolve the company could potentially prevent the company's dissolving action. This is grounded on the condition of s1003 and s1005 of the Companies Act 2006, which empowers creditors (among others) to object to the dissolution of your company. However, if the company is insolvent and does not have enough assets to cover its liabilities, it would be wise to consult an insolvency practitioner. The practitioner may work out a way for the company to pay its debts under an arrangement, or enter insolvency proceedings like liquidation, both voluntary and compulsory. However, if your background facts detail that your company does not currently hold any assets, it seems unlikely that a debt collector will be able to collect any funds from your business. In this case, they might try to assert that the company’s debt should become your personal liability, hence saying you should ""find the money from somewhere"". But usually, limited liability protection prevents this from happening. Nonetheless, wrongful trading (trading while you knew or ought to have known there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvency) can lead to personal liability. This is advanced under s214 Insolvency Act 1986. Usually, this is invoked in the case of insolvency procedures, which is not your current circumstance. Lastly, it should be noted that utility providers also have the right to object to a company's dissolution, hence insistence on paying the debt or entering an insolvency procedure. Therefore, you may want to revisit the terms of your contract with Utility Bidder to understand the implications better. This is a complex situation, and seeking advice from an insolvency practitioner or legal counsel will provide you with a more detailed understanding of your position."	28.194947242736816	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 411|Insolvency Act 1986 section 403|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA)|King v Anthony [1998] 2 B.C.L.C. 517|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form DS02|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM23|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form IC02
5	Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	Under English law, specifically the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, changes can be made to the membership of a creditors' committee. Firstly, removal of existing members: The manner in which existing members can be removed and replaced is regulated under Rule 17.19 of the Insolvency Rules 2016. According to this rule, a member of a creditors' committee in a corporate insolvency scenario may be removed by resolution of the creditors in a decision procedure. A decision procedure is typically an invitation to creditors to vote on a particular resolution or make a decision. This would involve a procedure laid down by the rules that can include a vote in person, by correspondence, electronic voting or any other decision procedure that the convener thinks fit. Secondly, addition of new members: The steps to add new members to the creditors' committee are similar. Rule 17.15 of the Insolvency Rules 2016 states that a creditor can become a member of a committee where the office-holder and a majority of the remaining creditor members agree; and the total number of creditor members does not fall below three. Or alternatively, a person may become a creditor committee member where a majority of the remaining creditor members of the committee (provided there are at least two) agree to the appointment, and the creditor agrees to serve. Furthermore, it should be noted that the office-holder has a duty to remove a person from office as a member of the committee if that person is not, or ceases to be, a creditor of the company and if their claim has been either paid in full before the committee's first meeting or secured after the committee's first meeting as per Rule 17.20 of the Insolvency Rules 2016. In terms of action, you would need to follow the relevant rules stated to initiate a decision procedure for creditors to vote on the removal and addition of members to the committee. This would typically involve presenting a resolution to the creditors for their consideration. However, it's important to consult with a specialist insolvency lawyer to ensure the correct procedures are followed while meeting all legal requirements.	39.6330943107605	1	The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 17.8|Insolvency Act 1986 section 301|Insolvency Act 1986 section 49	Re Smile Telecoms SA [2022] EWHC 740 (Ch)|St George’s Property Services (London) Ltd (in admin.), Re [2011] EWCA Civ858|Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.)

6	Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	"It sounds like the company is not insolvent or trading whilst insolvent, which are some of the triggering conditions to involve liquidators. In principle, you would not have to go into a formal insolvency process if your company was merely struggling and one director wished to exit the business. For your telecoms contract, if it has a long term with significant penalties for termination, then arguably you may be insolvent on a prospective basis because you know now that you won't be able to meet that liability when it falls due in the future. This falls under the cash-flow solvency test as per Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) and Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383. However, given that you have no other debts and no other issues, it seems unlikely that a court would consider the company insolvent purely on the basis of a single, disputed, future liability. Furthermore, the costs of going through liquidation would probably be far more than the penalty for early termination of the telecoms contract, if you could negotiate a settlement. Remember also that, as mentioned in BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch), a company's ability to pay its future debts depends on the ""balance of probabilities"", not absolute certainty. As for your colleague who wishes to leave, the company or remaining director could potentially buy out their share, depending on what your shareholder agreement says. You would use Companies House Form TM01 to notify Companies House that the director is stepping down – although you should check whether your company's Articles of Association specify that you need to have more than one director. If they do, you would need to appoint a replacement director (using Companies House Form AP01). This is quite a complex issue and you should consider obtaining legal advice that is specific to your situation. Additionally, this advice does not cover all possibilities and there may be other solutions available to you.

7	Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	I'm really sorry to hear about this frustrating situation. A lease agreement is legally binding, but there may be ways to seek solutions with your landlord. Strictly speaking, from a legal standpoint, the notice period for exercising a break clause in a lease is generally strictly adhered to by courts. Even a slight delay, such as the seven days mentioned in your case, might mean that the break clause has not been effectively exercised. This is based on legal precedents such as the case of Friends Life Ltd v Siemens Hearing Instruments Ltd [2014] EWCA Civ 382, where the courts have enforced strict compliance with break clause conditions. However, one possible argument to consider is if your prior discussions with the landlord and the landlord's actions to find a new tenant could amount to a waiver of the strict notice requirement, or acceptance of your notice. This could depend on the specifics of your communications and interactions. Moreover, given the current economic climate and changes since Covid-19, the Courts might show some flexibility, but there’s no legal precedent to guarantee this. In order to pursue any of these or other possible arguments, or if you can’t come to a resolution with the landlord, you should seek legal advice from a solicitor specializing in commercial property disputes. Legal advice should be sought as soon as possible as delay could prejudice your position. Additionally, you could explore whether there are other commercial ways to move forward, such as seeking to negotiate an early surrender of the lease in exchange for a financial settlement if you are in a position to offer such. Or possibly you could find a tenant willing to take an assignment or sublet of the lease. Again, it's crucial to bring this issue as soon as possible to a qualified legal professional who can assess the entire situation, including reviewing the exact wording of your lease, in order to provide you the best advice tailored to your situation.	31.028037548065186	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 319|Insolvency Act 1986 section 317|Companies Act 2006 section 266	BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)|Lazari Properties 2 Ltd v New Look Retailers Ltd [2021] EWHC 1209|Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v PRG Powerhouse Ltd [2007] EWHC 1002 (Ch)	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM05|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM19|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM21
8	Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	"Your situation is not unusual, particularly given the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on businesses. Let's look at some of the potential options. 1. Voluntary Liquidation: If you believe the company can no longer trade its way out of its financial difficulties, an option is to put it into liquidation. This would involve selling the company's assets to repay creditors according to their priority. You would need to appoint a licensed insolvency practitioner. Remember, if the company continues to trade while insolvent and unable to pay its debts as they fall due, you can be personally liable for new debts incurred. 2. Creditor Voluntary Arrangement (CVA): Under a CVA, the company can propose a deal with its creditors to repay a proportion of the debt over an agreed time. This would require the assistance of an insolvency practitioner and the approval of 75% of the company's creditors. 3. Administration: This is another form of insolvency procedure where an administrator (usually an insolvency practitioner) is appointed to restructure the company with the aim of saving it as a going concern, or to achieve a better result for creditors than immediate liquidation. 4. Selling the business as a going concern: Depending on the nature of your business and its assets, it might be possible to sell it as a going concern, even if this just involves the clients and Intellectual Property rather than physical assets. 5. Finally, dissolving the company: This last step involves striking the company off the Companies House register. This can only be done if the company is able to pay its debts. As far as leases are concerned, the terms of the lease agreement may allow you to terminate the contract early, return the vehicle or transfer the lease. Check the lease agreement for ""early termination"", ""return"" or ""transfer"" clauses. Seeking advice from your accountant is a crucial first step, they can provide insight on the financial position of the company. Getting legal advice is also important. Firms often provide an initial consultation free of charge, and this could help you understand the best path forward. An important element to keep in consideration is the issue of wrongful trading or fraudulent trading, codified in sections 214 and 213 of the Insolvency Act 1986. Directors who pursue these courses of action may find themselves personally liable for company debts. In the landmark case of Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38, the Supreme Court reinforced the idea of upholding contractual agreements made in good faith. Likewise, the Salomon v Salomon & Co [1897] AC 22 ruling established the principle of separate personality and limited liability, which provides directors with protection from company debts, as long as they act lawfully and responsibly. Remember, this advice is only intended to provide an overview of your potential options. You should seek professional legal and financial advice that takes into account your specific circumstances."	37.274518966674805	1	Companies Act 2006 section 231|Companies Act 2006 section 155|Companies Act 2006 section 154	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

9	Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	I'm sorry to hear about your situation. First, please note that while I'm an AI developed to provide initial guidance based on legal precedents and statutes, I'm not a replacement for professional legal advice. You definitely need to get in touch with an experienced corporate insolvency lawyer. Your situation can be complex. You mentioned illegal dividends, and while that sounds alarming, we must first establish where the fault lies. If these dividends were distributed while the company was insolvent, or they caused the company to become insolvent, it could be a potential issue. The case of McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) clarified that anticipation of profits leading to misfeasance and breach of fiduciary duty is unacceptable. Your new accountants seem to have determined that the dividends were 'illegal' presumably because they were declared in excess of the available distributable reserves of the company, contrary to part 23 Companies Act 2006. If the dividends were illegal, it is potentially possible for the company (or potentially a liquidator) to seek restitution. However, this can be a complex area and you should be aware that the outcome could depend on a range of factors, including the size of the dividends, the financial state of the company when they were declared and paid, and whether there was any dishonesty or unfitness on the part of directors. Given the complexities, it's crucial to get tailored advice based on your specific circumstances. A professional should be able to explore potential options that could, for example, involve reconstructing the company's debts or reaching an arrangement with creditors. Personal bankruptcy doesn't necessarily mean a definite end to your future prospects. The Insolvency Act 1986 provides a framework for people to make a new start once they are discharged from bankruptcy. However, it does have serious implications and should be considered a move of last resort. Please seek professional advice as soon as possible to figure out your best route forward.	29.182552814483643	1	Companies Act 2006 section 414|Companies Act 2006 section 393|Companies Act 2006 section 472	McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch)|Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477|Pathania v Tashie-Lewis [2021] EWHC 526 (Ch)|Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch)|Re Glam and Tan Ltd [2022] EWHC 855 (Ch)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)|Spectrum Plus Ltd, Re [2005] UKHL 41|Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch)|Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733|Morris v Bank of India [2004] EWHC 528 (Ch)	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form LIQ02|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form MT03|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form 600CH
10	Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE) applies when there is a 'relevant transfer', which can occur when a business or part of a business moves to a new owner or merges with another business to make a brand new employer. TUPE can also apply if a service provision change occurs - for example, if a contractor takes over activities from a client, or a new contractor takes over activities from another contractor (what's often referred to as 'outsourcing' or 'in-sourcing'). The specific situation you mention involves a potential 'business transfer' under TUPE. However, the application of TUPE in such scenarios is not automatic and depends on several factors. For TUPE to apply in a business transfer, there must be a transfer of an economic entity that retains its identity post transfer. An 'economic entity' is an organised grouping of resources that has the objective of pursuing an economic activity. The mere sale of assets alone, such as a premises, would not in itself amount to a business transfer under TUPE. Based on your illustration, critical factors would be whether the new butcher firm would be taking on more than just the premises - for example, if they were taking on the same workforce, the existing customer base, or significant equipment from the old butchery. The specific circumstances of each case would determine whether TUPE applies or not. Hence, professional advice based on the precise facts is advisable in these situations.	24.013502597808838	1	Companies Act 2006 section 1204|Companies Act 2006 section 853C|Companies Act 2006 section 247	SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7|Metro Nominees (Wandsworth) (No 1) Ltd v Rayment [2008] B.C.C. 40|Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2), Re [1990] B.C.C. 605	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form MR02|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form PSC04|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form PSC07
11	Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	"Firstly, I'm extremely sorry to hear about your situation and what you're going through. This is undoubtedly a challenging time, and I understand how the entire process can seem daunting. It's important for you to know I can only provide you with the legal information. You should always seek professional advice for your personal circumstances, which is what it's crucial to talk with your bank and also to consider consulting with a professional in insolvency, such as an insolvency practitioner or solicitor. As per the Companies Act 2006, directors can apply to have the company struck off the register but it's important to understand that you can only follow this route if the company is not in any legal disputes, is not trading or hasn't sold off any stock in the past three months, and it hasn't changed names within the previous three months. This is known as voluntary dissolution. However, if your company is insolvent, you may be limited in your options. You cannot apply to strike off a company if it's insolvent. You might consider liquidation or administration. The process may appear costly, but some insolvency practitioners might agree to handle the process with the understanding that they will be paid from selling the company's assets. When you say that HSBC advised that ""they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan"", it sounds like HSBC won't themselves force the company into liquidation, which is generally a step creditors sometimes take to recover money owed to them. However, from a legal perspective, issues can arise if a company is insolvent and continues trading. Directors can be personally liable for company debts in case of wrongful trading. Essentially, continuing to trade a company while knowingly insolvent can be considered fraudulent, and directors can face disqualification (Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986). Even if a company is dormant, you have certain responsibilities to Companies House, such as the timely filing of Confirmation Statements and accounts. If you do not fulfill these duties, Companies House may strike off the company. It's important to make the right moves to protect yourself and act in the interest of your creditors. I'd highly recommend seeking advice from insolvency professionals who can steer you based on a detailed understanding of your situation. I hope this information helps and good luck the future. What you are going through now can be an opportunity to learn and grow stronger, and I encourage you to stay positive during these trying times. Take care."	20.32630181312561	1	Companies Act 2006 section 899A|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251G|Insolvency Act 1986 section A18	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38|McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch)|Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477|Pathania v Tashie-Lewis [2021] EWHC 526 (Ch)|Re Pure Zanzibar Ltd [2022] EWHC 971 (Ch)|Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)|Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch)|Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733|Morris v Bank of India [2004] EWHC 528 (Ch)	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form LIQ02|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form RT01|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form MT03
12	Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you're having with your business partnership. Please note that while I can provide some general guidance, it's still important to seek advice from a solicitor specializing in partnership law, as your specific situation requires personalized advice which takes into account all of your circumstances and the terms of your partnership agreement. 1. Dissolving the Partnership: If you believe your partner has acted in breach of your partnership agreement and you cannot see a way for the partnership to continue, you can seek to dissolve the partnership. The Partnership Act 1890 provides that where no fixed term has been agreed upon for the duration of the partnership, any partner may determine the partnership at any time, by giving notice to all the other partners. 2. Expelling a Partner: Many partnership agreements include provisions for the expulsion of a partner. The exact process and grounds for expulsion will be set out in your partnership agreement. Usually, expulsion requires a certain majority of partners to agree. In your case, as you only have two partners, this may not be possible without agreement from your partner. 3. Taking over the Business: After dissolution, you may want to continue the business as a sole trader. This would require you to buy out your partner's interest in the assets of the business. It might be sensible to get an independent valuation of the business assets to ensure a fair price. 4. Goodwill: Goodwill is the reputation and connection of the business. If your partnership agreement doesn't specify, then under general law, goodwill is typically considered a partnership asset and is divided amongst the partners on dissolution. If you wish to continue the business, you would have to buy out your partner's share of the goodwill. 5. Intellectual Property: Intellectual property such as the business name, logo, etc., are also assets of the partnership. You would have to negotiate with your partner regarding these assets and potentially buy them out. 6. The Partner's Debt to the partnership: If your partner has taken money from the partnership, this could be considered a debt to the partnership and be deducted from any money they receive on dissolution. 7. Emotional Aspects: It's important to separate the emotional and business aspects as much as possible. Having legal representation can help with this. Remember, that the situations can get complicated and each case is unique, therefore professional legal advice is always recommended.	37.06862735748291	1	Companies Act 2006 section 75|Companies Act 2006 section 346|Insolvency Act 1986 section 390B	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

13	Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	As you are winding up your limited company, it's important to correctly prioritise payments and take the right steps throughout the process to ensure that you're treating creditors fairly and abiding by the legal requirements. In accordance with the Insolvency Act 1986, you are required to treat all creditors according to their rank. Typically, the order of priority is as follows: 1. Fixed Charge Creditors - These are usually lenders or banks that have a secured charge over a specific property, such as a mortgage. 2. Preferential Creditors - These are typically employees if there are any, but in your case, this category may not be applicable. 3. Floating Charge Creditors - These are usually banks / lenders with a charge over the remaining assets not covered by a fixed charge. 4. Unsecured Creditors - These include trade creditors, HMRC for VAT and PAYE, and utility companies amongst others. 5. Shareholders. Any assets or cash left in the company after repaying the creditor's should be returned to the shareholders (Directors). Based on your current scenario, it seems you fall into the category of unsecured creditors (energy, water, broadband). It is advised to distribute the remaining £600 proportionally amongst them. This should ideally be done following consultation with an insolvency practitioner who can help to ensure that the correct legal process is followed. After the company is officially dissolved, it ceases to exist and creditors won't usually be able to pursue it for unpaid debts. However, if the winding up process is not conducted properly and all creditors are not treated fairly, they could potentially apply to have the dissolution set aside or claim wrongful trading. Directors' loan accounts are typically treated as assets of the company and may need to be repaid to the company as part of the winding up process. Knowing more specifics about your situation would allow for more accurate advice, so please consider consulting with an insolvency practitioner or attorney.
