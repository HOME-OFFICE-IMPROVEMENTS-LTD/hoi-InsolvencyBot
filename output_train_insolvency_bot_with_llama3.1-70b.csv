Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	I can see that you're in a difficult situation. Based on the information you've provided, it appears that the other director has attempted to pass on the responsibility of winding up the company to you, despite the fact that you've already signed a stock transfer form to return your 5% shareholding. Firstly, it's essential to understand that signing a stock transfer form does not automatically remove you as a director of the company. To formally resign as a director, you would need to submit a TM01 form to Companies House, which you may not have done. In this situation, I would recommend that you take the following steps: 1. Send the keys back to the other director via recorded delivery, as you've already considered, to avoid any potential accusations of theft. 2. Write to the other director, stating that you have already signed a stock transfer form and intend to resign as a director. Request that they take immediate action to remove you as a director and update the company's records accordingly. 3. Submit a TM01 form to Companies House to formally resign as a director. This will help to clarify your position and prevent any further attempts to hold you responsible for the company's affairs. 4. Consider seeking advice from a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to help you navigate this situation. They can provide guidance on your responsibilities as a director and help you to understand your obligations in relation to the company's assets and debts. In terms of the company's insolvency, it's essential to understand that the other director's actions may be considered as an attempt to avoid their own responsibilities as a director. As a director, they have a duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. If the company is indeed insolvent, it may be necessary to consider a formal insolvency process, such as a creditors' voluntary liquidation (CVL) or a compulsory liquidation. However, this would require the involvement of a licensed insolvency practitioner and would need to be carefully managed to ensure that the company's assets are distributed fairly and in accordance with the law. Relevant case law, such as Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch), highlights the importance of considering both cash flow and balance sheet tests when determining a company's insolvency. In this case, it's essential to consider the company's financial position and determine whether it is indeed insolvent. Additionally, the Companies Act 2006 section 154 states that a private company must have at least one director, and a public company must have at least two directors. If the other director is attempting to pass on the responsibility of winding up the company to you, it's essential to consider whether this is a legitimate attempt to comply with the company's statutory obligations. In conclusion, I would recommend that you take immediate action to clarify your position as a director and seek advice from a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to help you navigate this situation. It's essential to understand your responsibilities as a director and to ensure that the company's affairs are managed in accordance with the law.	6.231504201889038	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 371 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 234 (Miscellaneous Provisions Applying to Companies Which are Insolvent or in Liquidation)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Lancefield v Lancefield [2002] 4 WLUK 467 (Jurisdiction; Partnerships; Winding-up orders)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|Bradcrown Ltd, Re [2002] B.C.C. 428 (Directors' duties and powers; Misconduct; Disqualification)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form AP01: Use this online form to appoint an individual as a company director.|Companies House Form TM01: Use this form to terminate the appointment of an individual or corporate director.|Companies House Form AM15: Use this form to give notice of the resignation of the administrator.
Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	I'm so sorry to hear about the situation you and your family are facing. It's unacceptable that your partner hasn't been paid his wages, and it's even more concerning that the subcontractor, X, is ignoring calls and texts. Firstly, I would recommend that your partner sends a formal letter to X, stating the amount owed, the dates of the work completed, and the fact that X has been ignoring his attempts to contact him. This letter should also request payment within a specific timeframe, e.g., 14 days. If X still fails to respond or pay, your partner may want to consider taking further action. One option is to issue a County Court claim against X for the unpaid wages. This can be done online or through a solicitor. However, please note that this process can take several months, and there are court fees involved. Regarding Y, the company that subcontracted to X, it's possible that they may be liable for the unpaid wages, especially if they knew or should have known about X's financial difficulties. Your partner may want to consider contacting Y and explaining the situation, but it's essential to be cautious and not to make any accusations without solid evidence. As for the massive UK house builder, it's unlikely that they would be directly liable for the unpaid wages, as they are several steps removed from the subcontractor, X. However, it may be worth contacting their customer service or complaints department to report the issue and express your concerns about the subcontractor's behavior. This may help to raise awareness and potentially lead to changes in their subcontracting practices. In terms of pursuing X, Y, and the massive UK house builder, it's essential to consider the following: 1. X: As the subcontractor, X is primarily responsible for paying your partner's wages. If X is ignoring calls and texts, it may be necessary to take further action, such as issuing a County Court claim. 2. Y: While Y may not be directly liable, they may have some responsibility for ensuring that their subcontractors are paying their workers. Your partner may want to consider contacting Y to report the issue and seek their assistance in resolving the matter. 3. Massive UK house builder: As mentioned earlier, it's unlikely that they would be directly liable, but reporting the issue to their customer service or complaints department may help to raise awareness and potentially lead to changes in their subcontracting practices. Before taking any further action, I would recommend that your partner seeks advice from a solicitor or a trade union representative, if applicable. They can provide guidance on the best course of action and help to navigate the complex legal landscape. In the meantime, I would suggest that your partner continues to try to contact X and Y to resolve the issue amicably. It's also essential to keep a record of all correspondence, including dates, times, and details of conversations. Please note that the above advice is general and not specific to your situation. It's essential to seek professional advice before taking any further action.

Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	I can sense the desperation and frustration in your situation. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, but I want to assure you that there are potential options and strategies that can be explored to mitigate the situation. Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the liquidators' primary goal is to maximize the recovery of assets for the creditors of Company A. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that Company B needs to be put into administration. Considering the cross-guarantee and the intercompany loan, it's crucial to assess the financial position of Company B and determine whether it can meet its obligations. If Company B is unable to pay the RLS loan and the intercompany loan, it may be possible to negotiate a settlement or a payment plan with the liquidators. One potential option could be to propose a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) for Company B. A CVA would allow Company B to restructure its debts and make payments to its creditors over a period of time, potentially avoiding administration. Another option could be to consider a sale of the industrial unit, but not necessarily through the liquidators. You could explore selling the property through a private sale or an auction, which might allow you to retain some control over the process and potentially achieve a better price. It's also important to consider the potential consequences of Company B being put into administration. This could result in the loss of control over the company, and the administrators may prioritize the interests of the creditors over those of the company and its stakeholders. In terms of the pressure from the liquidators, it's essential to respond to their demands in a timely and professional manner. You may want to consider seeking the advice of a specialist insolvency lawyer who can help you navigate the situation and negotiate with the liquidators. Lastly, I want to emphasize that it's not necessarily the end of the road for Company B or your business. With the right advice and guidance, it's possible to explore alternative solutions that can help mitigate the situation and potentially preserve the value of your business. I would recommend seeking the advice of a specialist insolvency lawyer who can provide you with tailored guidance and support. They can help you assess the situation, explore potential options, and develop a strategy to protect your business interests. Remember, there is always hope, and it's essential to stay focused and proactive in addressing the challenges you're facing.	5.250651121139526	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 95 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch) (Cash flows; Notion of insolvency; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidators' powers and duties; Misfeasance; Payments in insolvency)|Maxwell Communications Corporation Plc (No 2), Re [1993] B.C.C. 369 (Debt; Schemes of arrangement; Subordination)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Eurofood IFSC ltd, Re [2006] Ch. 508 C-341/04  (Centre of main interests; EU law; Commencement; Corporate insolvency; Insolvency proceedings; Recognition of judgments; Subsidiary companies)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form WU04: Use this form to give notice of the appointment of liquidator in a winding-up by the court.|Companies House Form AM22: Use this form to give notice of a move from administration to creditors' voluntary liquidation.|Companies House Form 600CH: Use this form to tell Companies House of an appointment of liquidator in a voluntary winding up by the members or creditors.
Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"In England, the general principle is that a company's assets and liabilities are separate from those of its directors and shareholders. This is known as the ""corporate veil"" principle, established in the landmark case of Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897] AC 22. However, in certain circumstances, the court may ""pierce the corporate veil"" and allow a creditor to access the assets of a company to satisfy a personal debt of a director or shareholder. This is typically done in cases where the company is being used as a sham or a facade to avoid personal liability. In the scenario you described, where a personal debt is owed by an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies, the creditor may attempt to access the assets of the companies to satisfy the debt. However, this would require the creditor to demonstrate that the companies are being used as a sham or a facade to avoid personal liability. The court may consider various factors when deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil, including: 1. Whether the company is being used to avoid personal liability or to perpetuate a fraud. 2. Whether the company is being used as a sham or a facade to conceal the true nature of the business or the identity of the individuals involved. 3. Whether the company is being used to evade taxes or other obligations. If the court determines that the companies are being used as a sham or a facade, it may allow the creditor to access the assets of the companies to satisfy the personal debt. It's worth noting that the Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 provides that a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. Additionally, the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 provide that a creditor may apply to the court for an order to wind up a company if it is unable to pay its debts. In summary, while the general principle is that a company's assets and liabilities are separate from those of its directors and shareholders, the court may pierce the corporate veil in certain circumstances to allow a creditor to access the assets of a company to satisfy a personal debt. However, this would require the creditor to demonstrate that the companies are being used as a sham or a facade to avoid personal liability. It's always recommended to seek the advice of a qualified insolvency lawyer to determine the best course of action in a specific situation."	6.982256650924683	1	Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 section 15|Insolvency Act 1986 section 373 (Individual Insolvency: General Provisions)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Companies Act 2006 section 1187 (Company directors: foreign disqualification etc)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	Based on the information provided, it appears that you have stopped trading and are in the process of dissolving your company. However, you have received a phone call from a debt collection agency on behalf of Utility Bidder, claiming that you have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3-year term and are chasing you for approximately £1,000 including VAT. Firstly, it's essential to understand that the debt collection agency's claim that you won't be able to dissolve the company due to the outstanding debt is incorrect. The dissolution process is a separate matter from the debt, and you can still proceed with the dissolution application. Regarding the debt, you should consider the following options: 1. **Dispute the debt**: If you believe that you have not broken the contract or that the debt is not valid, you can dispute it with Utility Bidder. You can request a copy of the contract and review it to understand your obligations. 2. **Negotiate a settlement**: If you acknowledge the debt, you can try to negotiate a settlement with Utility Bidder. You can offer to pay a lump sum or propose a payment plan, as suggested by the debt collection agency. 3. **Seek advice from an insolvency practitioner**: If you're unsure about the best course of action or need guidance on how to deal with the debt, you can consider seeking advice from an insolvency practitioner. They can help you understand your options and provide guidance on how to proceed. However, it's essential to note that you should not feel pressured into spending £2,000+ to settle a £1,000 debt. You should carefully consider your options and seek advice before making any decisions. In terms of the equipment and assets, as you mentioned that most of the equipment was yours, and you used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things, it's likely that the equipment is not considered company assets. However, it's crucial to ensure that you have properly accounted for all company assets and liabilities in your dissolution application. To proceed, you can: 1. **Respond to the debt collection agency**: Inform them that you are disputing the debt or negotiating a settlement, and request a copy of the contract. 2. **Seek advice from an insolvency practitioner**: If you're unsure about the best course of action or need guidance on how to deal with the debt. 3. **Proceed with the dissolution application**: Continue with the dissolution process, and ensure that you have properly accounted for all company assets and liabilities.

Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	I can provide you with some general guidance on this matter. However, please note that this is not a substitute for professional advice, and you should consult a qualified insolvency lawyer for specific guidance on your situation. The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 17.8 states that a creditors' committee may be established, and its membership may be changed, in accordance with the rules. Specifically, section 17.8(2) states that a creditor member may be removed from the committee if: * the office-holder and a majority of the remaining creditor members agree; and * the total number of creditor members does not fall below three. Additionally, section 17.8(3) states that a new creditor member may be appointed to the committee if: * a majority of the remaining creditor members of the committee (provided there are at least two) agree to the appointment; and * the creditor agrees to act. To remove existing members and replace them with new ones, you would need to follow the procedures outlined in the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016. This may involve: 1. Notifying the office-holder and the existing creditor members of the committee of your intention to remove and replace members. 2. Obtaining the agreement of the office-holder and a majority of the remaining creditor members to the removal and replacement of members. 3. Ensuring that the total number of creditor members does not fall below three. 4. Appointing new creditor members to the committee, with their agreement to act. To add new members to the committee, you would need to follow the procedures outlined in the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016. This may involve: 1. Notifying the office-holder and the existing creditor members of the committee of your intention to add new members. 2. Obtaining the agreement of a majority of the remaining creditor members of the committee (provided there are at least two) to the appointment of new members. 3. Ensuring that the new members agree to act. It is essential to note that the procedures for removing and replacing members, or adding new members, may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case. You should consult a qualified insolvency lawyer to ensure that you follow the correct procedures and comply with the relevant rules and regulations. In terms of the forms that need to be completed, you may need to use Companies House Form COM2: Notice of a change of membership of a creditors' or liquidation committee. However, please consult a qualified insolvency lawyer to ensure that you complete the correct forms and follow the correct procedures. Relevant case law, such as Re Smile Telecoms SA [2022] EWHC 740 (Ch), St George’s Property Services (London) Ltd (in admin.), Re [2011] EWCA Civ858, and Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.) Re [2014] EWHC 704 (Ch), may also be relevant to your situation. However, please consult a qualified insolvency lawyer to ensure that you understand the implications of these cases and how they may apply to your situation. In summary, while I can provide general guidance on this matter, it is essential to consult a qualified insolvency lawyer to ensure that you follow the correct procedures and comply with the relevant rules and regulations.	15.206308126449585	1	The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 17.8 (CREDITORS' AND LIQUIDATION COMMITTEE)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 301 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 49 (Receivership)	Re Smile Telecoms SA [2022] EWHC 740 (Ch) (Business restructuring; Classes of creditors; Debt restructuring; Discretion; Expert evidence; Foreign companies; Cross-border insolvency; Opposition; Schemes of arrangement)|St George’s Property Services (London) Ltd (in admin.), Re [2011] EWCA Civ858 (Administration; Administrators; Administrators' powers and duties; Extortionate credit transactions; Removal; Replacement administrators; Unsecured creditors)|Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.)

Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	I can provide you with some guidance on the situation you've described. Firstly, it's great to hear that the company has no debt and no overdrawn directors' accounts. However, the issue with the telecoms contract is a significant one. In this situation, the company is not insolvent in the classical sense, as it has no debts and is not unable to pay its debts as they fall due (Insolvency Act 1986, section 123). However, the company is facing a situation where it cannot continue to trade due to the departure of one of the shareholders/directors and the lack of work. The telecoms contract is a significant liability, and the company's inability to terminate it could be considered a contingent liability (Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)). However, the fact that the company has no other debts and is not insolvent in the classical sense means that it may not be necessary to appoint a liquidator solely for this reason. That being said, the company's directors have a duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors (Companies Act 2006, section 172). If the company is unable to continue to trade and is facing a significant liability, the directors may need to consider taking steps to protect the company's assets and minimize any potential losses. One option could be to seek advice from a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to explore the possibility of negotiating a settlement with the telecoms provider or seeking a court order to terminate the contract. Alternatively, the company could consider entering into a members' voluntary liquidation (MVL) to wind up the company in a controlled manner. An MVL would require the company to be solvent, and the directors would need to make a declaration of solvency (Insolvency Act 1986, section 89). The company would also need to appoint a liquidator to oversee the winding-up process. In terms of the process, the company would need to pass a resolution to wind up the company and appoint a liquidator (Companies Act 2006, section 84). The liquidator would then take control of the company's assets and liabilities and work to realize the assets and distribute the proceeds to the shareholders. It's worth noting that the company would need to file a number of forms with Companies House, including a Form AA02 to submit dormant accounts, a Form TM01 to terminate the appointment of the departing director, and a Form MT03 to notify Companies House of the moratorium (if applicable). I hope this provides some guidance on the situation. However, I would strongly recommend seeking advice from a solicitor or insolvency practitioner to explore the options in more detail and determine the best course of action for the company.	8.550829887390137	1	Companies Act 2006 section 3 (General introductory provisions)|Companies Act 2006 section 58 (A company's name)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7 (Creditors; Deeds; Distribution of assets; Equitable charges; Indemnities; Set-off; Subordination)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form AA02: Use this form to submit dormant accounts for a company limited by shares.|Companies House Form TM01: Use this form to terminate the appointment of an individual or corporate director.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.
Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	I can provide you with some guidance on this matter. It appears that you have failed to provide the required 3 months' notice to the landlord to exercise the break clause in the lease, and instead, you have given 2 months and 3 weeks' notice. The landlord is now arguing that you are too late and are liable for the final 2 years of the lease. In this situation, you may want to consider negotiating with the landlord to see if they are willing to accept the late notice and allow you to exit the lease early. You can point out that you had previously discussed your intention to exit the lease early with the landlord and that they had even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. This may suggest that the landlord was aware of your intention to exit the lease early and may be willing to be flexible. However, if the landlord is unwilling to accept the late notice, you may need to consider seeking legal advice to determine your options. You may want to consider arguing that the landlord has waived the requirement for 3 months' notice by their actions, such as arranging viewings for prospective tenants. Alternatively, you may want to consider arguing that the landlord's insistence on the 3 months' notice is unreasonable in the circumstances. It's also worth noting that the court may consider the following factors when determining whether to grant relief from the requirement for 3 months' notice: * The reason for the delay in serving the notice * The prejudice to the landlord if the notice is accepted * The prejudice to the tenant if the notice is not accepted * The conduct of the parties leading up to the service of the notice In terms of relevant case law, you may want to consider the following: * Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd [1997] AC 749, which held that a notice to exercise a break clause must be served in accordance with the terms of the lease, but that the court may grant relief from the requirement for strict compliance with the notice provisions if it is just and equitable to do so. * Avocet Industrial Estates LLP v Merol Ltd [2011] EWHC 3422 (Ch), which held that a landlord's waiver of a tenant's breach of a lease may be implied from the landlord's conduct, even if the landlord has not explicitly waived the breach. In terms of relevant statute, you may want to consider the following: * Section 1 of the Law of Property Act 1925, which provides that a notice to exercise a break clause must be served in accordance with the terms of the lease. * Section 146 of the Law of Property Act 1925, which provides that a landlord may waive a tenant's breach of a lease by their conduct. I hope this helps. However, please note that this is just general guidance and that you should seek specific legal advice from a qualified solicitor before taking any action.	6.270711421966553	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 266 (Derivative claims and proceedings by members)|Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)	BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Lazari Properties 2 Ltd v New Look Retailers Ltd [2021] EWHC 1209 (Classes of creditors; Company voluntary arrangements; Coronavirus; Debt restructuring; Equal treatment; Landlords' rights; Material irregularity)|Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v PRG Powerhouse Ltd [2007] EWHC 1002 (Ch) (Company voluntary arrangements; Unfairly prejudicial conduct)	Companies House Form AM05: Use this form to give notice of extension of time to seek approval of the administrator's proposals.|Companies House Form AM19: Use this form to give notice of the extension of period of administration.|Companies House Form AM21: Use this form to give notice of the end of administration.
Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	I can see that you're facing a difficult situation with your business, and it's essential to explore your options carefully. Based on the information you've provided, I'll offer some guidance on the potential paths forward. Firstly, it's crucial to acknowledge that the amounts involved, although not huge, can still have a significant impact on your business and personal finances. Given the current state of your business, it's understandable that you're considering closing or selling the company. To begin with, I recommend that you discuss the following options with your accountant: 1. **Voluntary Liquidation**: This process involves winding up the company's affairs, realizing its assets, and distributing the proceeds to creditors. As the company has a good trading history, this might be a viable option. However, you'll need to consider the potential tax implications and the impact on your personal finances. 2. **Administration**: This process involves appointing an administrator to take control of the company's affairs, with the goal of rescuing the business or achieving a better outcome for creditors. However, this option might not be suitable if the company's financial situation is too severe. 3. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: A CVA is a formal agreement between the company and its creditors to pay off debts over time. This option might be suitable if you believe the company can recover with a restructuring plan. 4. **Selling the business**: If you're unable to recover the business, selling it might be an option. However, you'll need to consider the potential sale value, the impact on employees, and the tax implications. Regarding the specific issues you've mentioned: * **BBL Natwest balance**: You've mentioned that the balance is around £14k, and you've been paying consistently until January. You may want to discuss with your accountant the possibility of negotiating a payment plan or seeking a temporary repayment holiday. * **Overdraft (OD) with bank**: You've mentioned that the OD has a directors' guarantee, and you could potentially cover this with the sale of assets. However, you should carefully review the guarantee and consider seeking advice on your personal liability. * **Outstanding invoices**: You've mentioned that there are outstanding invoices from the closure of the retail store, totaling around £7k. You may want to discuss with your accountant the possibility of negotiating with creditors or seeking a payment plan. * **Lease cars**: You've mentioned that there are two lease cars with one year left on the lease, but without a directors' guarantee. You should review the lease agreements and consider seeking advice on your potential liability. In terms of next steps, I recommend that you: 1. **Meet with your accountant**: Discuss the options mentioned above and seek their advice on the best course of action. 2. **Review your financial situation**: Carefully review your company's financial statements, including the balance sheet, profit and loss account, and cash flow statement. 3. **Seek professional advice**: Consider seeking advice from a corporate insolvency lawyer or a business rescue specialist to help you navigate the process. 4. **Keep records up to date**: Ensure that your company's records are up to date, including the register of directors, register of members, and minutes of meetings. Remember that the decision to close or sell a business is never easy, but seeking professional advice and exploring your options carefully can help you make an informed decision. Please note that this is not a substitute for professional advice, and you should seek guidance from a qualified accountant or lawyer before making any decisions.	8.907394170761108	1	Companies Act 2006 section 155 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	I'm so sorry to hear about the situation you're facing. It's understandable that you're concerned about the potential consequences of bankruptcy on your future prospects. Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that the situation you're in is not uncommon, and there are ways to address the issues you're facing. Given the complexity of your situation, I would strongly recommend seeking independent advice from a qualified insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in insolvency law. Regarding the £35,000 in illegal dividends, it's crucial to understand that this is a serious matter. As a director, you have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company, and taking excessive dividends can be considered a breach of that duty. The case of McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) highlights the importance of directors' duties and the potential consequences of misfeasance. In terms of the potential for bankruptcy, it's essential to consider the options available to you. You may want to explore alternative solutions, such as an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) or a Debt Relief Order (DRO). However, these options will depend on your specific circumstances, and it's crucial to seek professional advice to determine the best course of action. The equipment and cash in the business may be considered assets that can be used to pay off creditors. However, the liquidator's role is to realize the assets and distribute them among the creditors. It's essential to understand that the liquidator's primary goal is to maximize the return for the creditors, not to protect your personal interests. Given the situation, it's likely that the liquidator will investigate the company's affairs, including the payment of dividends and the management of the company's finances. This may lead to further action, including potential disqualification as a director. In terms of seeking independent advice, I would recommend consulting with a solicitor specializing in insolvency law or an insolvency practitioner. They can provide you with guidance on the best course of action and help you navigate the complex process. Some potential options to consider: 1. Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA): This is a formal agreement between you and your creditors to pay off a portion of your debts over a set period. 2. Debt Relief Order (DRO): This is a formal order that can be made by the court to write off a portion of your debts. 3. Bankruptcy: This is a formal process that can be used to deal with debts that cannot be paid. It's essential to understand that each of these options has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's crucial to seek professional advice to determine the best course of action for your specific situation.

Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006) applies in situations where there is a transfer of an undertaking, business, or part of an undertaking or business, from one employer to another. This can include a change of ownership, a merger, or a transfer of a contract. In the scenario you described, where a new butcher is taking over the premises of a butcher that has gone into administration, TUPE may apply. However, it depends on the specific circumstances. For TUPE to apply, there must be a transfer of an economic entity that retains its identity. This means that the new business must be taking over the same or similar activities, and the transfer must involve the transfer of assets, employees, or customers. In this case, if the new butcher is simply taking over the premises and starting a new business, TUPE may not apply. However, if the new butcher is taking over the assets, equipment, and employees of the old business, or is continuing to operate the business in a similar way, then TUPE may apply. The key factors to consider are: 1. Is the new business taking over the same or similar activities as the old business? 2. Is the new business taking over the assets, equipment, and employees of the old business? 3. Is the new business continuing to operate the business in a similar way to the old business? If the answer to these questions is yes, then TUPE may apply, and the new business may be required to take on the employees of the old business, along with their existing contracts and terms and conditions. It's worth noting that the administrators of the old business may have a duty to inform the employees of the potential transfer and to consult with them about the implications of TUPE. The new business may also have a duty to inform the employees of the transfer and to provide them with information about their new employer. In any case, it's recommended that the employees of the old business seek advice from a trade union representative or an employment lawyer to understand their rights and options under TUPE.	5.4089415073394775	1	Companies Act 2006 section 1204 (Business names)|Companies Act 2006 section 853C (Annual confirmation of accuracy of information on register)|Companies Act 2006 section 247 (A company's directors)	SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7 (Creditors; Deeds; Distribution of assets; Equitable charges; Indemnities; Set-off; Subordination)|Metro Nominees (Wandsworth) (No 1) Ltd v Rayment [2008] B.C.C. 40 (Administration; Breach of covenant; Business tenancies; Forfeiture; Permission)|Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2), Re [1990] B.C.C. 605 (Administration; Duty of care; Sale of business; Unfairly prejudicial conduct)	Companies House Form MR02: Use this form to register particulars of a charge where property has been acquired and the charge was created on or after 6 April 2013.|Companies House Form PSC04: Use this form to give notice of change of details for person with significant control.|Companies House Form PSC07: Use this form to give notice of ceasing to be an individual person with significant control, relevant legal entity or other registrable person.
Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	I can see that you're going through a difficult time with your business, and it's heartbreaking to have to consider closing it down after so many years. I'm here to offer some guidance and support. Firstly, it's great to hear that HSBC has been supportive and offered a long-term no affordability arrangement. This can help alleviate some of the financial pressure. Regarding the closure of the company, you have a few options to consider: 1. **Voluntary Strike-Off**: You can apply to Companies House to strike off the company voluntarily. This is a relatively straightforward process, but it requires that the company has no outstanding debts or liabilities, apart from the Bounce Back Loan. You'll need to complete Form DS01 and submit it to Companies House. 2. **Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL)**: If you have no assets to distribute to creditors, you can consider an MVL. This involves appointing a liquidator to wind up the company's affairs. However, this process can be more expensive than a voluntary strike-off. 3. **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL)**: If you have outstanding debts, including the Bounce Back Loan, you may need to consider a CVL. This involves appointing a liquidator to wind up the company's affairs and distribute any assets to creditors. In your case, since you have no other outstanding debts apart from the Bounce Back Loan, and HSBC has indicated that they won't liquidate the company, a voluntary strike-off might be the most suitable option. However, before proceeding, you should consider the following: * Ensure that you have no other outstanding debts or liabilities, apart from the Bounce Back Loan. * Check that you have complied with all relevant statutory requirements, such as filing annual accounts and returns with Companies House. * Consider seeking professional advice from an accountant or insolvency practitioner to ensure that you're following the correct procedures. Regarding the Bounce Back Loan, you should note that the loan is a debt owed to the government, and you may need to consider the implications of not repaying the loan. However, since HSBC has indicated that they won't liquidate the company, it's likely that the loan will be written off. In terms of the timeline, you can apply to strike off the company at any time, but you should ensure that you've completed all necessary steps and complied with relevant statutory requirements. I hope this information helps, and I'm here to answer any further questions you may have.	6.400876760482788	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A18 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251G (Debt relief orders)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)|Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477 (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors; Disqualification; Misconduct)|Pathania v Tashie-Lewis [2021] EWHC 526 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Transactions at an undervalue)|Re Pure Zanzibar Ltd [2022] EWHC 971 (Ch) (Creditors' voluntary winding-up; Directors disqualification; Disqualification periods; Mitigation; Wrongful trading)|Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors disqualification; Directors' powers and duties;)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25 (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' powers and duties; Contingent liabilities; Directors' liabilities; Knowledge; Liquidation; Wrongful trading)|Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733 (Damages; Directors; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidation; Wrongful trading; iNVESTIGATING AND SUPPRESSING MISCONDUCT)|Morris v Bank of India [2004] EWHC 528 (Ch) (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Vicarious liability; Parent company; Tortious liability)	Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form RT01: Use this form to apply to Companies House to get your company restored.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.
Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	I can provide you with some guidance on the technicalities of ending the partnership and potential pitfalls to consider. Firstly, it's essential to review your partnership agreement to understand the terms and conditions that govern the partnership, including the process for expulsion and dissolution. Since you have a thorough partnership agreement, it's likely that it outlines the procedures for resolving disputes and ending the partnership. Given the circumstances, it appears that you have grounds to expel your partner from the partnership due to their breach of the partnership agreement, particularly regarding cash handling and record-keeping. However, as a two-partner partnership, expulsion would likely result in the instant dissolution of the partnership. To continue the business alone, you may need to consider the following options: 1. Buy-out: You could offer to buy out your partner's share of the business, which would involve valuing the business and negotiating a purchase price. This could be a complex process, and you may need to seek professional advice to ensure a fair valuation. 2. Dissolution and re-formation: You could dissolve the partnership and re-form the business as a sole trader or a new company. This would involve winding up the existing partnership, settling any outstanding debts, and re-establishing the business under a new structure. 3. Negotiation: You could try to negotiate a settlement with your partner, which could involve a payment to them in exchange for their agreement to leave the partnership and not pursue any claims against you. Regarding the goodwill and intellectual property, it's essential to review your partnership agreement to understand the terms and conditions that govern these assets. If the agreement is silent on this issue, you may need to seek professional advice to determine the best course of action. In terms of potential pitfalls, you should be aware of the following: 1. Dispute resolution: The process of ending the partnership and resolving any disputes could be time-consuming and costly. You may need to seek professional advice to ensure that you are following the correct procedures and protecting your interests. 2. Valuation: Valuing the business and determining the purchase price could be a complex process, and you may need to seek professional advice to ensure a fair valuation. 3. Tax implications: The dissolution of the partnership and any subsequent re-formation of the business could have tax implications. You should seek professional advice to ensure that you are meeting your tax obligations and minimizing any tax liabilities. 4. Employee rights: You should be aware of the rights of your employee and ensure that you are meeting your obligations as an employer. To reassure you, it's essential to remember that you have taken the first step by identifying the issues and seeking advice. By following the correct procedures and seeking professional advice, you can protect your interests and ensure a smooth transition. In terms of the technicalities of ending the partnership, you may need to consider the following: 1. Notice of expulsion: You may need to serve a notice of expulsion on your partner, which would outline the reasons for their expulsion and the process for resolving any disputes. 2. Winding-up: You may need to wind up the partnership, which would involve settling any outstanding debts and distributing any remaining assets. 3. Dissolution: You may need to dissolve the partnership, which would involve filing a notice of dissolution with the relevant authorities. 4. Re-formation: If you decide to re-form the business, you may need to register a new company or sole trader and obtain any necessary licenses and permits. I hope this guidance has been helpful. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.	11.373223781585693	1	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	Based on the information provided, it appears that you are in the process of winding up your limited business. You have stopped trading, moved out of your premises, and have no official debt apart from directors' loans and some outstanding direct debits. In terms of prioritizing payments, you should follow the order of distribution as set out in the Insolvency Act 1986, section 124. This means that you should pay the following in the following order: 1. Preferential creditors (e.g. employees, but you have no employees) 2. Secured creditors (e.g. your landlord, but you have already agreed to vacate the premises) 3. Unsecured creditors (e.g. energy, water, and broadband providers) 4. Directors' loans (i.e. the loans you and your wife have made to the company) You have £600 left in the business account, which should be used to pay the unsecured creditors. You should prioritize the energy provider, as they are likely to be the largest creditor. If you are unable to pay the full amount owed to the energy provider, you should contact them to explain the situation and negotiate a payment plan. They may be willing to accept a reduced payment or allow you to pay in installments. It's also worth noting that as a director, you have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. This means that you should not prioritize your own interests (e.g. paying off the directors' loans) over those of the creditors. Once you have paid the unsecured creditors, you can then consider paying off the directors' loans. However, you should be aware that paying off the directors' loans may be subject to challenge by the creditors or the liquidator, if the company is placed into liquidation. In terms of what will happen when the creditors chase you for any remainder, it's likely that they will send you a letter or email requesting payment. If you are unable to pay, they may take further action, such as sending a debt collection agency or taking court action. However, as you are winding up the company and have no assets, it's unlikely that the creditors will be able to recover the full amount owed. They may need to write off the debt or accept a reduced payment. It's recommended that you seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor to ensure that you are following the correct procedures and meeting your obligations as a director.	6.64925742149353	1	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.
