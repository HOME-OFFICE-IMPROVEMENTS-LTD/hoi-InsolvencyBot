Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	Thank you for seeking legal advice regarding your situation. Based on the information provided, here are the key points and recommendations: 1. Director Status - Simply signing a stock transfer form does not automatically remove you as a director - According to Companies Act 2006 section 154, a private company must have at least one director - Your removal as director needs to be properly filed with Companies House using Form TM01 - Until this is done, you remain legally registered as a director with associated duties and responsibilities 2. Current Situation Assessment - The company may be facing insolvency issues, given the other director's request to sell assets and pay debts - Following BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28, the company's solvency needs to be assessed based on both: * Cash flow test (ability to pay debts as they fall due) * Balance sheet test (assets versus liabilities) 3. Immediate Actions Recommended: a) Check Your Status: - Verify your current status as director on Companies House website - If still registered, request immediate removal using Form TM01 - Keep copies of all correspondence and documents b) Protect Yourself: - Do not dispose of any company assets without proper legal advice - Document return of keys via recorded delivery as proposed - Keep copies of the note from the other director 4. Legal Obligations: - As per Bradcrown Ltd, Re [2002] B.C.C. 428, directors can be held liable for improper handling of company assets - If the company is insolvent, under IA 1986 section 234, all company property must be properly accounted for 5. Next Steps: a) Seek immediate professional assistance to: - File proper documentation for your resignation as director - Assess the company's financial position - Consider whether formal insolvency proceedings are necessary b) If the company is insolvent: - Consider making a winding-up petition under IA 1986 section 124 - Ensure all actions comply with directors' duties to creditors The situation requires careful handling to protect your interests while fulfilling your legal obligations. I strongly recommend seeking immediate assistance from an insolvency practitioner to properly manage this situation and ensure compliance with all legal requirements. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide additional guidance on specific aspects of your situation?	16.432244062423706	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 371 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 234 (Miscellaneous Provisions Applying to Companies Which are Insolvent or in Liquidation)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Lancefield v Lancefield [2002] 4 WLUK 467 (Jurisdiction; Partnerships; Winding-up orders)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|Bradcrown Ltd, Re [2002] B.C.C. 428 (Directors' duties and powers; Misconduct; Disqualification)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form AP01: Use this online form to appoint an individual as a company director.|Companies House Form TM01: Use this form to terminate the appointment of an individual or corporate director.|Companies House Form AM15: Use this form to give notice of the resignation of the administrator.

Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	"As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I understand your difficult situation. Here's my legal advice: 1. Primary Claim Against Company X: - Under the Insolvency Act 1986 s.123, if X owes your partner more than £750 and hasn't paid for 3 weeks after a formal demand, this could be grounds for proving the company is unable to pay its debts. - Your partner should send a formal statutory demand for the £1,800 owed. If unpaid after 21 days, this could form the basis of a winding-up petition under s.124. 2. Limited Liability and Corporate Veil: - Following Salomon v Salomon, each company in the chain (X, Y, and the house builder) is typically treated as a separate legal entity with limited liability. - However, there may be exceptions if we can prove wrongdoing. As in Gilford Motor Co v Horne, if X is using the corporate structure as a sham to avoid paying debts, the corporate veil might be pierced. 3. Claims Against Y and the House Builder: - Based on Adams v Cape Industries, it's generally difficult to hold parent/contracting companies liable for subcontractors' debts. - However, if there's evidence of a ""single economic unit"" as in DHN Food Distributors, or if the arrangement was deliberately structured to avoid paying workers, there might be grounds for action. Practical Steps: 1. Document everything - all communications, promises of payment, and work completed 2. Send a formal statutory demand to X 3. Consider reporting X to: - The house builder (reputational pressure) - HMRC (if tax obligations aren't being met) - Companies House (if there's evidence of director misconduct) 4. Legal Options: - Small claims court action against X - If X becomes insolvent, register as a creditor - Consider whether there's evidence to pierce the corporate veil under the principles in Prest v Petrodel Given the amount involved (£1,800), a small claims court action might be the most cost-effective route. However, if X is genuinely insolvent, recovery might be difficult. Would you like me to provide more specific information about any of these options?"	12.211341857910156	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Companies Act 2006 section 43 (A company's capacity and related matters)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 222 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	I understand this is an extremely difficult situation, and I'll provide some legal analysis and potential options. Key Legal Issues: 1. Cross-guarantee liability for the RLS loan 2. Intercompany loan repayment demands 3. Potential insolvency of Company B 4. Pressure from liquidators Legal Analysis: 1. Company A's Liquidation: - Under s.123 of the Insolvency Act 1986, Company A's inability to pay debts led to liquidation - The liquidator has duties to maximize returns for creditors (HLC Environmental Projects Ltd case) 2. Cross-Guarantee Liability: - The RLS loan cross-guarantee makes Company B liable for Company A's debt - Per BNY Corporate Trustee Service v Eurosail, Company B's ability to meet liabilities must be assessed on balance of probabilities 3. Intercompany Loan: - The liquidator has a duty to recover the intercompany loan as an asset of Company A - Based on Casa Estates, both cash-flow and balance-sheet tests must be considered for Company B's solvency Potential Options: 1. Scheme of Arrangement: - Consider a scheme of arrangement under Companies Act 2006 - Maxwell Communications case shows schemes can help restructure debt - This could help reorganize Company B's obligations 2. Moratorium: - Under IA 1986 s.A16, you might seek a moratorium to get breathing space - This could provide time to arrange refinancing or restructuring 3. Negotiate with Liquidators: - Propose a payment plan for the intercompany loan - Cheyne Finance case suggests future ability to pay can be considered 4. Independent Advice: - Seek independent insolvency practitioner advice - Consider second opinions on Company B's valuation Immediate Actions Required: 1. Document all assets and liabilities of Company B 2. Prepare detailed cash flow forecasts 3. Consider appointing independent financial advisors 4. Keep detailed records of all decisions and reasoning Warning: Under HLC Environmental Projects, directors must act in creditors' interests when approaching insolvency. Failure to do so could lead to personal liability. Next Steps: 1. Urgently seek detailed financial advice 2. Consider appointing restructuring specialists 3. Explore refinancing options for Company B 4. Document all decisions and rationale Don't give up - there are often solutions available with proper professional advice. I would recommend: 1. Immediately seeking an independent insolvency practitioner 2. Getting a fresh valuation of the industrial unit 3. Exploring refinancing options 4. Considering formal restructuring procedures Would you like me to provide more specific details about any of these options?	20.90529441833496	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 95 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch) (Cash flows; Notion of insolvency; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidators' powers and duties; Misfeasance; Payments in insolvency)|Maxwell Communications Corporation Plc (No 2), Re [1993] B.C.C. 369 (Debt; Schemes of arrangement; Subordination)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Eurofood IFSC ltd, Re [2006] Ch. 508 C-341/04  (Centre of main interests; EU law; Commencement; Corporate insolvency; Insolvency proceedings; Recognition of judgments; Subsidiary companies)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form WU04: Use this form to give notice of the appointment of liquidator in a winding-up by the court.|Companies House Form AM22: Use this form to give notice of a move from administration to creditors' voluntary liquidation.|Companies House Form 600CH: Use this form to tell Companies House of an appointment of liquidator in a voluntary winding up by the members or creditors.

Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I can advise that company assets generally cannot be seized to pay a director's personal debts. This principle stems from the fundamental concept of separate legal personality established in Salomon v Salomon & Co [1897], which held that a company is a distinct legal entity from its shareholders and directors. Key points to consider: 1. Separate Legal Personality: - The companies you direct are separate legal entities with their own assets, rights, and liabilities - This separation is protected even for sole directors, as confirmed in Salomon v Salomon 2. Corporate Veil: - The corporate veil can only be pierced in very limited circumstances - As established in Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013], the courts will only pierce the veil when the company is being used as a facade to evade legal obligations or frustrate legal rights 3. Exceptions: The company's assets might be accessible if: - The assets are actually held on trust for you personally (as in Prest v Petrodel) - The company is proven to be a mere sham to evade personal obligations (Gilford Motor Co v Horne) - There has been improper transfer of personal assets to the company to avoid creditors 4. Protection of Company Assets: - As confirmed in MacDonald Dickens & Macklin v Costello [2011], courts will respect proper contractual arrangements between companies and their directors - Company assets belong to the company and must be used for company purposes Practical Advice: 1. Keep clear separation between personal and company finances 2. Maintain proper company records and documentation 3. Ensure all company assets are properly registered to the company 4. Consider seeking professional advice if creditors attempt to access company assets If creditors are pursuing you personally, they would need to enforce against your personal assets, not those of your companies, unless they can prove one of the exceptional circumstances for piercing the corporate veil.	35.173041582107544	1	Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 section 15|Insolvency Act 1986 section 373 (Individual Insolvency: General Provisions)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Companies Act 2006 section 1187 (Company directors: foreign disqualification etc)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	Based on the situation described, here is my legal advice: 1. Insolvency Position: - Under s.123 of the Insolvency Act 1986, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if it cannot pay them as they fall due (cash flow test) or if its liabilities exceed its assets (balance sheet test). - Following Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014], both tests should be considered together to determine insolvency. - The fact that the company has ceased trading and has no funds to pay the £1,000 debt suggests it is insolvent under the cash flow test. 2. Options Available: a) Voluntary Strike Off: - The creditor is correct that they can object to a voluntary strike off while there are outstanding debts. - If they object, Companies House will suspend the strike off process. b) Formal Insolvency: - Given the relatively small debt (£1,000) and limited assets, a Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) costing £2,000+ would be disproportionate. 3. Personal Liability Protection: - Based on Belmont Park Investments [2011], if you acted in good faith and the company was properly run, the corporate veil should protect you from personal liability. - However, ensure all company assets and personal assets were properly separated to maintain this protection. 4. Recommended Actions: 1) Document clearly which assets belong to you personally vs. the company 2) If the strike off is objected to, consider: - Negotiating a settlement with the creditor for a reduced amount - If they threaten winding up proceedings, note that under s.124 IA 1986, they would need to show a debt exceeding £750 - The creditor may be reluctant to incur the costs of winding up proceedings for such a small debt 5. Warning: - Based on BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016], directors must consider creditors' interests when a company is approaching insolvency. - Ensure you maintain good records of all decisions and transactions to demonstrate you acted properly. Recommendation: Continue with the strike off application but prepare for potential objection. If objected to, engage with the creditor to explain the situation and potentially negotiate. Given the small amount involved, it may not be commercially viable for them to pursue formal insolvency proceedings. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide additional information about specific aspects of the situation?	14.883833408355711	1	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|King v Anthony [1998] 2 B.C.L.C. 517 (Individual voluntary arrangements; Insolvency practitioners)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form DS02: Use this form to withdraw your company's striking off application.|Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form IC02: Use this form to give notice that a company no longer wishes to be an investment company.

Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I can advise you on the situation regarding changes to the creditors' committee. Here's my analysis: 1. Legal Framework for Changes to Creditors' Committee: The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, section 17.8 provides the key requirements for changing committee membership: - Changes require agreement from the office-holder and a majority of remaining creditor members - The total number of creditor members must not fall below three - New members must agree to act 2. Process for Making Changes: a) Removing and Replacing Members: - You need majority agreement from remaining committee members - The office-holder must agree - New members must consent to appointment - Use Companies House Form COM2 to notify changes b) Adding New Members: - Must maintain compliance with committee size requirements - Need agreement from existing committee majority - New members must formally agree to serve 3. Important Considerations: Based on Re Smile Telecoms SA [2022], if you have concerns about the committee's actions, you should: - Gather evidence of how the committee is not acting in creditors' best interests - Present this evidence to the office-holder - Consider filing formal objections if necessary 4. Practical Steps: 1. Write to the office-holder (administrator/liquidator) expressing your concerns 2. Request a creditors' meeting to discuss committee composition 3. Propose specific changes with alternative members 4. Ensure proper documentation using Form COM2 5. Maintain minimum of three creditor members 5. Legal Requirements: The formation and operation of the committee must comply with: - Insolvency Act 1986 (relevant sections) - Insolvency Rules 2016 - Proper notice and voting procedures If the original committee was formed without proper procedure, you may also challenge its validity through the court system. Recommendation: 1. First, formally document how the current committee is not acting in creditors' best interests 2. Follow formal procedures for proposing changes using appropriate forms 3. Ensure all proposed changes have proper support from remaining members 4. Consider seeking court intervention if proper procedures weren't followed in the committee's formation Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific guidance on implementing these changes?	13.62719464302063	1	The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 17.8 (CREDITORS' AND LIQUIDATION COMMITTEE)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 301 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 49 (Receivership)	Re Smile Telecoms SA [2022] EWHC 740 (Ch) (Business restructuring; Classes of creditors; Debt restructuring; Discretion; Expert evidence; Foreign companies; Cross-border insolvency; Opposition; Schemes of arrangement)|St George’s Property Services (London) Ltd (in admin.), Re [2011] EWCA Civ858 (Administration; Administrators; Administrators' powers and duties; Extortionate credit transactions; Removal; Replacement administrators; Unsecured creditors)|Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.)

Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	Based on the information provided, I'll give you advice regarding your situation: 1. Insolvency Assessment: According to the Insolvency Act 1986 s.123, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if either: - It fails the cash-flow test (cannot pay debts as they fall due) - It fails the balance sheet test (assets less than liabilities) The telecoms contract liability needs to be considered as a future liability. As established in Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007], prospective debts must be considered when assessing insolvency. 2. Options Available: a) Voluntary Liquidation: Given that: - One director wishes to leave (use Form TM01 to remove them) - The business cannot continue with one director - There's a significant future liability (telecoms contract) You may need to consider voluntary liquidation. b) Legal Position: Under IA 1986 s.122(1)(f), a company can be wound up if it's unable to pay its debts. The telecoms contract liability could trigger this if it makes the company balance sheet insolvent. 3. Specific Recommendations: a) First steps: - Calculate total assets vs liabilities (including the telecoms contract) - If assets exceed liabilities, consider negotiating with the telecoms provider - Document all decisions carefully to show compliance with directors' duties (BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA) b) If liquidation is necessary: - Consider Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) - The liquidator can deal with the telecoms contract as part of the insolvency process - This provides protection against personal liability if handled properly 4. Important Considerations: - The anti-deprivation principle (Belmont Park Investments) protects creditors' interests - As directors, you must act in good faith and in creditors' interests when approaching insolvency - BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail established that insolvency should be determined on the balance of probabilities 5. Next Steps: 1. Seek professional insolvency practitioner advice 2. Document company's financial position thoroughly 3. Consider filing Form MT03 if a moratorium is needed 4. Maintain good records of all decisions and reasoning Given the circumstances, liquidation might be necessary primarily due to the telecoms contract liability, but professional insolvency practitioner advice should be sought to confirm this and ensure proper handling of the process.	12.381896495819092	1	Companies Act 2006 section 3 (General introductory provisions)|Companies Act 2006 section 58 (A company's name)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7 (Creditors; Deeds; Distribution of assets; Equitable charges; Indemnities; Set-off; Subordination)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form AA02: Use this form to submit dormant accounts for a company limited by shares.|Companies House Form TM01: Use this form to terminate the appointment of an individual or corporate director.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.

Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I'll provide advice regarding your situation with the lease break clause: Legal Position: 1. Break clauses in commercial leases are strictly construed by courts. The notice requirements must be followed precisely, including timing requirements. Missing the notice period by even one day can invalidate the break notice. 2. Based on the facts provided, you have missed the contractually required 3-month notice period by 7 days, which technically means the break notice is invalid. However, there are several factors to consider: Potential Arguments in Your Favor: 1. Prior Communications: The fact that you had previous discussions with the landlord about exercising the break clause and they even arranged viewings could be relevant. This shows: - The landlord had actual knowledge of your intentions - They acted upon this knowledge (arranging viewings) - There may be an argument for estoppel based on their conduct 2. Potential Solutions: a) Negotiation Route: - Given the landlord's prior cooperation and arrangement of viewings, you could negotiate a mutual surrender of the lease - This might involve offering some compensation for the short notice - Reference the landlord's previous cooperative stance and their actions in arranging viewings b) CVA Consideration: - If your company is facing financial difficulties, you might consider a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) - The Lazari Properties 2 Ltd v New Look Retailers Ltd [2021] case shows courts will support reasonable CVAs that treat creditors fairly - However, this is an extreme solution and should only be considered if there are broader financial issues c) Directors' Duties: - Per BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016], directors must consider creditors' interests when the company faces financial difficulties - If remaining in the premises would cause financial strain, directors should document their decision-making process Practical Advice: 1. Immediately engage with the landlord in written correspondence: - Acknowledge the late notice - Reference previous discussions and viewings - Propose a compromise solution 2. Consider offering: - Additional rent for the notice period shortfall - Assistance in finding a new tenant - A lump sum settlement 3. Document everything: - Keep records of all previous communications about the break clause - Maintain minutes of relevant board meetings - Record reasons for the delay in serving notice 4. If negotiations fail: - Seek professional valuation of the remaining lease term - Consider whether the cost of remaining versus settling is more commercially viable - Evaluate whether broader restructuring might be necessary Warning: The landlord is legally entitled to enforce the full term of the lease given the invalid break notice. You should prepare for this possibility while pursuing negotiations. This is a complex situation requiring careful handling. I would recommend: 1. Immediate engagement with the landlord 2. Professional documentation of all communications 3. Consideration of commercial compromise options 4. Preparation for potential litigation if necessary Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or explore specific aspects in more detail?	14.74629259109497	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 266 (Derivative claims and proceedings by members)|Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)	BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Lazari Properties 2 Ltd v New Look Retailers Ltd [2021] EWHC 1209 (Classes of creditors; Company voluntary arrangements; Coronavirus; Debt restructuring; Equal treatment; Landlords' rights; Material irregularity)|Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v PRG Powerhouse Ltd [2007] EWHC 1002 (Ch) (Company voluntary arrangements; Unfairly prejudicial conduct)	Companies House Form AM05: Use this form to give notice of extension of time to seek approval of the administrator's proposals.|Companies House Form AM19: Use this form to give notice of the extension of period of administration.|Companies House Form AM21: Use this form to give notice of the end of administration.		0.0		0	
Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	Thank you for providing the details of your situation. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I'll provide advice based on the relevant laws and circumstances: 1. Assessment of Insolvency: Based on Insolvency Act 1986 section 123, your company may be deemed unable to pay its debts if: - You're struggling with daily cash flow - You have outstanding invoices that can't be covered by asset sales - The business appears to be no longer viable 2. Limited Liability Protection: Following Salomon v Salomon & Co. [1897], your personal assets are protected from company debts unless: - You've given personal guarantees (as with the overdraft) - There's evidence of wrongdoing or breach of directors' duties 3. Options Available: a) Voluntary Liquidation: - Under Insolvency Act 1986 section 122, you can resolve to wind up the company - This would be appropriate given the company's financial situation - Would provide an orderly closure of the business b) Sale of Business: - Could explore selling the business as a going concern - Must ensure compliance with directors' duties under BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA 4. Specific Considerations: Debts: - BBL (£14k): Government-backed loan - Overdraft (£6k): Personally guaranteed - Outstanding invoices (£7k): Company liability - Lease cars: Company liability without personal guarantees 5. Recommended Actions: 1. Immediate Steps: - Document all financial decisions carefully - Continue paying what you can to maintain good faith - Keep detailed records of all attempts to trade through difficulties 2. Professional Assistance: - Consult with a licensed insolvency practitioner - Continue working with your accountant - Consider seeking legal advice for personal guarantee implications 3. Directors' Duties: Following BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA, you must: - Act in creditors' interests when insolvency threatens - Make decisions to minimize losses to creditors - Keep accurate financial records The most appropriate course of action appears to be voluntary liquidation, given: - Ongoing cash flow difficulties - Reduced customer base - Inability to meet all financial obligations This would provide an orderly wind-down while ensuring compliance with your duties as directors under the Companies Act 2006 and protecting your position as much as possible. Would you like me to provide more specific information about any of these aspects or discuss alternative options in more detail?	12.476945161819458	1	Companies Act 2006 section 155 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	Thank you for seeking legal advice regarding your situation. I understand your concerns, and I'll provide guidance based on the relevant law and cases. Key Issues: 1. Illegal dividends of £35,000 2. Outstanding personal tax liabilities 3. Company unable to trade out of difficulties 4. Concerns about personal bankruptcy and future prospects Legal Analysis: 1. Directors' Duties and Illegal Dividends: - Under Re Glam and Tan Ltd [2022] EWHC 855 (Ch), directors can be personally liable for repayment of illegal dividends paid in breach of fiduciary duty - BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25 establishes that directors must consider creditors' interests when the company is insolvent or bordering on insolvency 2. Potential Director Disqualification: - Following Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477, disqualification proceedings aim to protect the public from directors of insolvent companies who pose a danger to creditors - Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch) shows that serious incompetence, even without dishonesty, can justify disqualification 3. Wrongful Trading: - Under Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch), the court won't use hindsight to determine if you should have concluded the company had no reasonable prospect of avoiding liquidation - Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733 demonstrates that if directors act appropriately given the information available, they may avoid wrongful trading liability Practical Advice: 1. Immediate Actions: - Seek immediate professional insolvency practitioner advice - Consider using Form MT03 to implement a moratorium to provide breathing space - Prepare accurate statements of affairs (Form LIQ02) 2. Options to Consider: - Voluntary arrangement with creditors - Orderly voluntary liquidation (Form 600CH) - Negotiate repayment plans for illegal dividends 3. Mitigating Factors: - Your reliance on professional accountants may help defend against disqualification - Proactively addressing issues once discovered shows good faith - No evidence of deliberate misconduct 4. Protection Against Personal Liability: - Document all decisions and professional advice received - Maintain clear records of when issues were discovered - Consider professional indemnity claim against previous accountants Recommendations: 1. Urgently seek an independent insolvency practitioner's advice 2. Consider whether the company meets the insolvency test under IA 1986 s.123 3. Prepare detailed documentation of the accounting issues and when discovered 4. Consider negotiating with creditors before formal insolvency 5. Investigate potential claims against previous accountants While the situation is serious, bankruptcy isn't inevitable. The key is to act quickly and transparently while seeking appropriate professional advice. Your prompt action upon discovering the issues may help defend against personal liability and disqualification proceedings.

Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	"As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I can advise on whether TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006) would apply in this situation. TUPE can potentially apply in two scenarios: 1. Business transfers 2. Service provision changes In this case of a butcher's shop, we need to consider if there is a ""relevant transfer"" under TUPE. The key factors to consider are: 1. Whether there is a transfer of an economic entity that retains its identity 2. The similarity of activities before and after the transfer 3. Whether there is a transfer of significant tangible assets 4. Whether customers are transferred 5. The degree of similarity between activities carried on before and after the transfer In the scenario you describe, where a new butcher takes over the same premises and continues similar business activities, TUPE could potentially apply if there is sufficient similarity between the old and new businesses. However, merely operating from the same premises is not enough on its own - there needs to be a transfer of the business as a going concern. Given that the original business has gone into administration, this adds complexity. Looking at relevant case law: 1. In Re Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2) [1990], the court emphasized the importance of protecting interests during business transfers in administration. 2. The administrator would need to consider their duties under the Insolvency Act 1986 to achieve the best outcome for creditors while also considering TUPE obligations. For TUPE to apply in this case, you would need to establish: - Transfer of business assets (not just premises) - Continuation of same type of business activity - Transfer of customer relationships/goodwill - Transfer of employees' work in practice I would recommend: 1. Seeking clarity on exactly what assets/elements of the business are being transferred 2. Consulting with the administrator about the nature of any proposed transfer 3. Getting legal advice on specific TUPE obligations if a relevant transfer is established The mere fact of operating the same type of business from the same premises is not sufficient on its own for TUPE to apply - there needs to be a genuine transfer of the business undertaking."	10.343839406967165	1	Companies Act 2006 section 1204 (Business names)|Companies Act 2006 section 853C (Annual confirmation of accuracy of information on register)|Companies Act 2006 section 247 (A company's directors)	SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7 (Creditors; Deeds; Distribution of assets; Equitable charges; Indemnities; Set-off; Subordination)|Metro Nominees (Wandsworth) (No 1) Ltd v Rayment [2008] B.C.C. 40 (Administration; Breach of covenant; Business tenancies; Forfeiture; Permission)|Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2), Re [1990] B.C.C. 605 (Administration; Duty of care; Sale of business; Unfairly prejudicial conduct)	Companies House Form MR02: Use this form to register particulars of a charge where property has been acquired and the charge was created on or after 6 April 2013.|Companies House Form PSC04: Use this form to give notice of change of details for person with significant control.|Companies House Form PSC07: Use this form to give notice of ceasing to be an individual person with significant control, relevant legal entity or other registrable person.		0.0		0	
Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	Thank you for seeking legal advice regarding your company's situation. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I'll provide guidance based on the relevant law and circumstances you've described. Key Legal Considerations: 1. Company's Financial Position - Based on s.123 of the Insolvency Act 1986, your company appears to be insolvent as it's unable to pay its debts as they fall due - The BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25 case establishes that directors' duties shift to consider creditors' interests when a company is insolvent or bordering on insolvency 2. Directors' Duties - You appear to have acted in good faith and responsibly by: * Using the Bounce Back Loan appropriately for business purposes * Maintaining communication with creditors (HSBC) * Recognizing when the business is no longer viable - This aligns with the principles in Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733 regarding appropriate director conduct 3. Options Available: a) Striking Off - Given that HSBC is supportive and you only have the Bounce Back Loan as debt, striking off might be possible - However, you must ensure: * The company has ceased trading * All creditors are notified * No legal proceedings are pending b) Voluntary Liquidation - While this would be the most proper route, I understand the financial constraints - The lack of assets means there may be little benefit to creditors from formal liquidation Recommendations: 1. Document Everything - Keep detailed records of: * All decisions made * Communications with HSBC * Company's financial position - This protects you against potential future claims as per Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch) 2. Formal Closure Process - Consider applying for striking off if: * HSBC confirms this in writing * No other creditors emerge * Company has ceased trading for 3 months - Use Companies House Form DS01 for striking off application 3. Future Considerations - Be aware that creditors can object to striking off - The company can be restored to the register later if issues arise - Keep all company records for at least 6 years Warning: The Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd case highlights the importance of proper conduct. While your actions appear appropriate, ensure all steps are documented and proper procedures followed to avoid any risk of director disqualification. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific guidance about the striking off process?	12.797862768173218	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A18 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251G (Debt relief orders)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)|Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477 (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors; Disqualification; Misconduct)|Pathania v Tashie-Lewis [2021] EWHC 526 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Transactions at an undervalue)|Re Pure Zanzibar Ltd [2022] EWHC 971 (Ch) (Creditors' voluntary winding-up; Directors disqualification; Disqualification periods; Mitigation; Wrongful trading)|Official Receiver v Arron [2021] EWHC 1587 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors disqualification; Directors' powers and duties;)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022] UKSC 25 (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Johnson v Beighton [2019] EWHC 895 (Ch) (Investigating and suppressing misconduct; Directors' powers and duties; Contingent liabilities; Directors' liabilities; Knowledge; Liquidation; Wrongful trading)|Singer v Beckett [2001] BPIR 733 (Damages; Directors; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidation; Wrongful trading; iNVESTIGATING AND SUPPRESSING MISCONDUCT)|Morris v Bank of India [2004] EWHC 528 (Ch) (Investigating and Suppressing Misconduct; Directors' duties and powers; Vicarious liability; Parent company; Tortious liability)	Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form RT01: Use this form to apply to Companies House to get your company restored.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.

Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	Thank you for providing such a detailed situation. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I can provide the following advice: 1. Partnership Dissolution Given the breach of partnership terms and trust, you have grounds to dissolve the partnership. In a two-partner situation, expulsion would automatically lead to dissolution since a partnership requires at least two partners. The case of Lancefield v Lancefield [2002] demonstrates that courts can intervene in partnership matters in exceptional circumstances, which misappropriation of funds could constitute. 2. Breach of Fiduciary Duty Your partner's actions in taking money without proper accounting and disclosure represents a breach of fiduciary duty. Similar to principles established in Gencor ACP Ltd v Dalby [2000], where improper handling of company funds was addressed, your partner has breached their duty to the partnership. 3. Continuing the Business Regarding continuing the business alone: - You can continue trading as a sole trader - The partnership agreement's non-compete and goodwill clauses would be enforceable if they're reasonable - The business name and intellectual property would typically be partnership assets that need to be valued and dealt with in dissolution 4. Steps to Take: a) Document everything: - Keep records of all cash discrepancies - Maintain evidence of breach of partnership terms - Record all communications regarding the situation b) Consider: - Getting a formal valuation of the business - Calculating exact amounts owed/taken - Preparing a dissolution agreement 5. Protection Moving Forward To protect yourself: - Consider seeking an injunction if necessary to prevent further misappropriation - Secure all partnership assets and records - Take control of banking arrangements The principles from MacDonald Dickens & Macklin v Costello [2011] suggest courts will respect properly documented business arrangements, so ensuring all dissolution arrangements are properly documented is crucial. I would recommend: 1. Seeking immediate accounting assistance to quantify exact losses 2. Consulting a partnership dispute solicitor for specific dissolution advice 3. Considering mediation before court proceedings 4. Preparing a formal dissolution agreement 5. Securing professional valuations of partnership assets Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific guidance on any particular aspect?	12.904035568237305	1	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	Thank you for providing these details about your situation. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I'll provide advice based on the relevant laws and cases. Key Legal Points: 1. Limited Liability Protection: Following Salomon v Salomon & Co [1897], your company is a separate legal entity from you personally. This means you should generally be protected from personal liability for company debts, unless specific exceptions apply. 2. Winding Up Options: Based on Insolvency Act 1986 s.122, you have two main options: - Members' Voluntary Liquidation (if the company is solvent) - Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (if insolvent) 3. Insolvency Test: Under Insolvency Act 1986 s.123, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if: - It cannot pay debts as they fall due - Assets are less than liabilities Priority of Payments: The order of priority should be: 1. Secured creditors (if any) 2. Preferential creditors (including certain employee claims) 3. Unsecured creditors (including utilities and trade creditors) 4. Directors' loans (lowest priority) Practical Advice: 1. Assessment of Solvency: - Calculate total assets (£600 + any other assets) - List all liabilities (energy, water, broadband, directors' loans) - If liabilities exceed assets, the company is technically insolvent 2. Next Steps: - If solvent: Use Form DS01 to strike off the company (£8 online) - If insolvent: Consider Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation 3. Dealing with Creditors: - Contact utility companies immediately - Negotiate payment arrangements - Document all agreements in writing 4. Directors' Loans: Following MacDonald Dickens & Macklin v Costello [2011], these should be treated as subordinate to other creditors. Warning: The principle from Belmont Park Investments [2011] emphasizes the importance of good faith in commercial transactions. Ensure all actions in winding up are transparent and documented to avoid any suggestion of improper conduct. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific guidance about your next steps?	12.081690311431885	1	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.
