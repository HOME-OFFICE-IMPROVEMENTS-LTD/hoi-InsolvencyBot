Q1	I set up a limited liability company in 2015. My business suffered greatly during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it still hasn’t recovered yet. I fell into arrears, and one of my suppliers submitted a winding-up petition against my business. A friend of mine is willing to invest money in my company. Do I have good chances of avoiding a liquidation order if my friend commits to pumping money into my business?	Thank you for seeking legal advice regarding your company's situation. Let me provide you with comprehensive advice based on the relevant laws and cases: 1. COVID-19 Impact and Protection: Based on Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch), you would need to clearly demonstrate that COVID-19 has directly affected your business's financial position. However, you must prove that your business wasn't already failing before the pandemic. The court will require concrete evidence of how COVID-19 specifically impacted your business operations and finances. 2. Friend's Investment Offer: Regarding your friend's offer to invest, the case of Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy is particularly relevant. The court held that mere hopes or expectations of future funding, without firm legal commitments, are insufficient to prevent a winding-up order. You would need: - A legally binding investment agreement - Clear evidence of your friend's ability to provide the funds - A detailed business recovery plan 3. Legal Options: a) Moratorium Application: Under Section A4 of the Insolvency Act 1986, you could apply for a moratorium to get breathing space. You would need to demonstrate that: - A moratorium would achieve a better result for creditors than immediate winding up - There's a viable plan for company rescue b) Challenging the Petition: Under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986, you could challenge the petition by proving either: - Cash flow solvency (ability to pay debts as they fall due) - Balance sheet solvency (assets exceeding liabilities) 4. Important Considerations: Based on Cheyne Finance plc and Casa Estates cases, the court will consider: - Both current and future debts - Both cash flow and balance sheet tests - The overall financial viability of your business 5. Recommended Actions: 1. Document all COVID-19 impacts on your business 2. Formalize your friend's investment offer into a legally binding agreement 3. Consider filing Form MT03 for a moratorium 4. Prepare a detailed business recovery plan 5. Gather evidence of your company's viability post-investment 6. Warning: Under Section 208 of the Insolvency Act 1986, you must be completely honest about your company's financial position and assets during this process to avoid personal liability. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific guidance about any particular aspect?	11.817389488220215	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 208 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A4 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	"Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch) (Coronavirus; Winding-up petition)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q2	My business has been running at a deficit for a few years. In 2021, I got a loan from NatWest to stay afloat. I have given my share in the family home (50%) as a collateral for this loan. I am now unable to repay it. What should I do? Can the bank repossess my house?	Based on your situation, here is my legal advice: 1. Assessment of Your Situation: - You are experiencing financial difficulties with your business running at a deficit - You have a personal guarantee secured against your share of the family home - You're unable to repay the NatWest loan 2. Legal Position: Under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 123, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if: - It cannot pay debts as they fall due (cash flow insolvency) - The value of assets is less than liabilities (balance sheet insolvency) 3. Immediate Actions: a) Contact NatWest immediately to: - Discuss restructuring the loan - Request a payment holiday - Negotiate new terms b) Consider formal rescue procedures: - Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) - Administration (as discussed in Rowntree Ventures Ltd v Oak Property Partners Ltd) 4. Personal Liability and Your Home: - As you've provided personal security, the bank can potentially claim against your share of the property - Under Insolvency Act 1986 section 332, special provisions apply to dwelling houses - The bank would need a court order to enforce their security 5. Options to Consider: a) Business Solutions: - Restructuring the business - Seeking additional investment - Selling non-essential assets b) Personal Protection: - Consider personal bankruptcy as a last resort - Seek protection under Insolvency Act provisions - Negotiate with the bank to protect your home interest 6. Professional Support: I strongly recommend: - Engaging an insolvency practitioner - Seeking financial advice - Consulting a property lawyer regarding your home rights 7. Warning: If you continue trading while insolvent, you could face personal liability under wrongful trading provisions (as per Johnson v Beighton [2019]).

Q3	My business (a small restaurant in Egham) is saddled with debt towards several suppliers. I do have a loyal customer base, but I feel that I need to reduce my debt burden. My brother offered to buy my business for a fair price, and he also told me he would like to retain me and some of my employees. However, he says that I need to deal with my debt before selling the business to him. I don’t have savings. What can I do?	Thank you for providing these details about your restaurant business situation. As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I'll provide advice based on the relevant law and your specific circumstances. First, let's assess your insolvency position: 1. Insolvency Test Based on Re Cheyne Finance and BNY Corporate Trustee Service v Eurosail, we need to consider both: - Cash flow test: Whether you can pay debts as they fall due - Balance sheet test: Whether assets exceed liabilities 2. Options Available: a) Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA): - This might be your best option if your business is fundamentally viable (evidenced by your loyal customer base) - It would allow you to: * Continue trading * Negotiate with creditors * Potentially sell the business to your brother as part of the arrangement * Retain employment for yourself and staff b) Administration: - Could provide breathing space through a moratorium (per IA 1986 s.A16) - Allows for business restructuring - Protects from creditor actions c) Pre-pack Administration: - This might be particularly suitable given your brother's interest - Would allow for: * Quick sale to your brother * Preservation of business value * Employee retention * Clean slate regarding debts 3. Important Considerations: a) Good Faith: - Following Belmont Park Investments, any arrangement must be made in good faith - The sale to your brother must be at market value to avoid challenges under Casa Estates regarding transactions at undervalue b) Director's Duties: - Per BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana, you must consider creditors' interests when the company is approaching insolvency - Need to document all decisions carefully 4. Recommended Action Plan: 1. Seek immediate professional assistance from an insolvency practitioner 2. Consider a CVA or pre-pack administration 3. Have the business professionally valued 4. Document all decisions and rationale 5. Maintain transparent communication with creditors 5. Required Documentation: - If proceeding with insolvency: Complete Form LIQ02 (statement of affairs) - Ensure all company records are up to date - Maintain detailed financial records Warning: Under s.123 of the Insolvency Act 1986, if any creditor is owed more than £750 and issues a statutory demand, this could trigger compulsory liquidation if not addressed within 21 days. Would you like me to provide more specific details about any of these options or explain how to proceed with a particular course of action?	12.90234923362732	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 149 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q4	I own a pub in Windsor. I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, by additional taxes on alcohol as well as by a reduction in my customer base. I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). I reached an agreement with my bank and with most of my suppliers to delay the repayment of my debt. The HMRC won’t listen and they are threatening legal actions against me. What can I do? HMRC counts for roughly 50% of my unsecured debt (the debt towards the bank is secured by a collateral on my pub).	Based on your situation, here is my legal advice: 1. Assessment of Insolvency Status: According to Re Cheyne Finance and Casa Estates, we need to consider both cash-flow and balance-sheet tests to determine insolvency. Given that you're struggling with payments to HMRC and suppliers, you may be approaching cash-flow insolvency. However, as established in BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail, we need to assess your ability to meet liabilities on the balance of probabilities. 2. Available Options: a) Company Moratorium: - Under IA 1986 s.A28, you could apply for a moratorium which would give you breathing space from creditors, including HMRC - This would provide temporary protection while you develop a rescue plan - Forms MT02 and MT03 would be relevant for managing the moratorium process - The moratorium would allow you to continue trading while protecting you from creditor action b) Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA): - This might be particularly suitable as you've already reached agreements with your bank and some suppliers - Under CA 2006 s.899A, you could propose a formal arrangement with creditors - HMRC would be bound by a CVA if approved by 75% of creditors by value 3. Risk Assessment: The threat from HMRC is serious because: - Under IA 1986 s.123, HMRC could petition for winding up if debts remain unpaid - As per Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy, mere hopes of future funding won't prevent a winding-up order 4. Recommended Action Plan: 1) Immediately seek protection through a moratorium: - This will prevent HMRC from taking immediate action - Use this time to prepare a formal restructuring proposal 2) Prepare a CVA proposal: - Include realistic payment terms for HMRC - Ensure the proposal treats creditors fairly - Consider the secured creditor's position (your bank) 3) Consider professional assistance: - Appoint an insolvency practitioner to act as monitor - They can help negotiate with HMRC 5. Important Considerations: - The Belmont Park case emphasizes the importance of good faith in commercial arrangements - Under BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana, you must consider creditors' interests given the company's financial position - Post-COVID considerations (as per Petitioner v Company [2022]) may be relevant if any of your difficulties stem from the pandemic 6. Warning: Failure to address these issues could result in: - HMRC pursuing a winding-up petition under IA 1986 s.124 - Personal liability issues if trading continues while insolvent - Potential disqualification under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific guidance on implementing any of these options?	14.947434186935425	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A28 (Moratorium)|Companies Act 2006 section 899A (Arrangements and reconstructions: general])|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251G (Debt relief orders)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131 (Coronavirus; Demands; Inability to pay debts; Loan agreements; Winding-up petitions

Q5	I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, as well as by a reduction in my customer base (I run a pub in Ascot). I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). My landlord is demanding an extortionate amount of money for my rent. While I agreed to a new, 5-year leasing agreement, I realised that I am operating at a loss unless my rent is reduced and the HMRC agrees to a repayment plan. What can I do?	Based on your situation, here's my legal advice: 1. Financial Distress Assessment Your business is showing signs of financial distress with: - Arrears to HMRC - Supplier payment issues - Unsustainable rent obligations - Operating at a loss 2. Restructuring Options a) Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA): - This could help restructure your debts while continuing to trade - Following Oceanfill Ltd v Nuffield Health Wellbeing Ltd [2022], you could potentially include rent restructuring in a formal arrangement - Would need 75% creditor approval by value b) Moratorium: - Consider applying for a moratorium using Form MT03 to get breathing space - Provides temporary protection from creditors while you develop a rescue plan - Allows time to negotiate with HMRC and landlord 3. Directors' Duties Following BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016]: - As a director, you must consider creditors' interests when the company is in financial difficulty - Need to act in good faith and in the company's best interests - Must avoid making the company's position worse 4. Practical Steps 1) HMRC: - Apply for a Time to Pay arrangement - HMRC often agrees to reasonable payment plans if approached proactively 2) Landlord: - Negotiate rent reduction - Consider break clause options - Professional mediation might help reach agreement 3) Suppliers: - Review contracts - Negotiate payment terms - Prioritize essential suppliers 5. Legal Protection The Belmont Park case emphasizes the importance of good faith in commercial arrangements. Any restructuring should: - Be transparent - Have legitimate commercial purpose - Not attempt to evade insolvency laws 6. Recommendations 1) Seek immediate professional advice from: - Insolvency practitioner - Accountant - Property lawyer regarding lease 2) Consider formal restructuring: - CVA might be most appropriate - Allows continuation of business - Can include rent and HMRC debt restructuring 3) Document all decisions: - Keep detailed board minutes - Record all creditor communications - Maintain clear financial records The key is to act quickly while maintaining good faith with creditors. The sooner you address these issues, the more options you'll have available. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific guidance on any particular aspect?	12.802191972732544	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 222 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)|Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 224 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Oceanfill Ltd v Nuffield Health Wellbeing Ltd [2022] EWHC 2178 (Ch) (Business restructuring; Debt restructuring; Guarantors; Schemes of arrangement; Summary judgments)	Companies House Form LIQ03: Use this form to give notice of progress report in voluntary winding up.|Companies House Form RT01: Use this form to apply to Companies House to get your company restored.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.
Q6	I am a real estate developer. Due to the current housing crisis, my mortgages have ballooned, and I am struggling to make money out of the sale of the properties I recently completed. While my housing portfolio is significant, most properties are not yet ready for the market. I am not paying all my suppliers, and the banks are chasing me multiple times per day. If they foreclose, I lose everything. If I complete all my projects, I can repay the banks and the suppliers. However, one of them just filed a petition for winding up my business. I refuse to believe I am insolvent. Is it likely that the petition will be dismissed?	"As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I must advise you that your situation appears serious, and the petition is unlikely to be dismissed based on the information provided. Here's why: 1. Cash Flow Insolvency: According to Section 123(1)(e) of the Insolvency Act 1986, a company is deemed unable to pay its debts if ""it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due."" The fact that you're not paying your suppliers indicates cash flow insolvency. As established in Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007], the court will consider both current and prospective debts. 2. Balance Sheet Test: Per Section 123(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986 and reinforced in Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014], both cash-flow and balance-sheet tests must be considered together. While you have significant assets (property portfolio), they're not readily convertible to cash, and your current liabilities exceed your liquid assets. 3. Future Prospects: Your argument that completing the projects would enable you to pay creditors is likely to be insufficient. In Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986), the court held that mere hopes and expectations of future funding without any rights to those assets are irrelevant. 4. Available Options: Instead of fighting the petition, consider: 1. Applying for a moratorium under Section A4 of the Insolvency Act 1986, which could provide breathing space to reorganize 2. Negotiating with creditors for additional time 3. Seeking administration to protect the business while completing projects The BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] case established that insolvency is determined on the balance of probabilities. Given your current inability to pay suppliers and pressure from banks, the court is likely to find you insolvent unless you can demonstrate immediate ability to pay debts as they fall due. I recommend seeking immediate professional assistance to explore these options before the petition hearing. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or discuss specific restructuring options?"	10.766415357589722	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A4 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 7.4 (WINDING UP BY THE COURT)	Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch) (Coronavirus; Winding-up petition)|Rushbrooke UK Ltd v 4 Design Concepts Ltd [2022] EWHC 1110 (Ch) (Cross-Border Insolvency; Authority; Directors; Injunctions; Statutory demands; Striking out; Winding-up petitions)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|One Blackfriars Ltd (in liq.), Re [2021] EWHC 684 (Ch) (Administration; Administrators' powers and duties; Conflict of interest; Valuation)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form WU07: Use this form to give notice of a progress report in a winding-up by the court.|Companies House Form DS02: Use this form to withdraw your company's striking off application.|Companies House Form MT03: Tell Companies House that a moratorium has ended early.
Q7	My brother and I have been working together on our hand-made furniture shop for 20+ years. Last year, we had to liquidate the business because we could no longer pay the bills. An official receiver was appointed. Yesterday, he came back to us and asked to repay all the dividends we received in the 5 years before insolvency. This is a ridiculous amount of money (£150,000 each). My brother and I never received a salary. The official receiver says that we could not get any dividends because the business was operating at a loss. We were only paid in dividends to avoid income tax, and because my accountant told me that was fine. Surely, we don’t have to repay that money?	Based on the information provided, I'll give you advice regarding the official receiver's demand for dividend repayment: 1. Legal Position on Dividends: - Under the Companies Act 2006, dividends can only be paid out of profits available for distribution - If the company was operating at a loss, paying dividends would be unlawful as there were no distributable profits - The case of BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA emphasizes directors' duties to consider creditors' interests when a company is approaching insolvency 2. Directors' Duties: - As directors, you had fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of the company - The fact that you were advised by an accountant doesn't eliminate your responsibilities - Following Kaytech Int'l Plc, Re, you were de facto directors with full responsibilities under company law 3. Tax Avoidance Structure: - While Salomon v Salomon established that tax planning through corporate structures is legitimate - Using dividends instead of salary specifically to avoid tax when the company was loss-making could be seen as improper - This could be viewed as similar to the situation in Gilford Motor Co. Ltd v Horne where corporate structures were used improperly 4. Official Receiver's Powers: - Under Insolvency Act 1986 section 132, the official receiver has broad investigative powers - They can pursue unlawful dividends paid within the relevant period before insolvency - The receiver's actions appear to be within their statutory powers Advice: 1. The demand for repayment appears legally valid as: - The dividends were unlawfully paid when the company was loss-making - The 5-year lookback period is within standard limitation periods - The fact that this was your only income doesn't make the dividends legal 2. Options: - Negotiate a repayment plan with the official receiver - Seek professional accounting evidence if you believe there were actually distributable profits - Consider personal insolvency options if repayment is impossible 3. Future Protection: - Always ensure proper salary structures are in place - Maintain clear separation between personal and company finances - Seek proper legal advice before implementing tax planning strategies Warning: You may also face director disqualification proceedings under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 for allowing unlawful dividends. I recommend seeking immediate legal representation for both the dividend repayment issue and potential disqualification proceedings.	12.580347537994385	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 399 (Public Administration (England and Wales))|Insolvency Act 1986 section 132 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 13.2 (OFFICIAL RECEIVER)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

Q8	My business went into liquidation last year. I was the owner and director. A liquidator was appointed. He is threatening to sue me for breaching my duties as a director unless I return the money I received as monthly repayments for a loan I gave to my company. He’s also threatening to start a disqualification procedure against me for the same reason. I believe I did nothing wrong – this was a fair loan with interests below the market rate. However, I cannot risk being disqualified, because I am also working as a director in my sister’s company. What can I do? Should I return the money?	Thank you for seeking legal advice regarding this serious matter. Let me provide a structured analysis of your situation: 1. Legal Framework and Director's Duties: Based on HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch), directors have a duty to act in the company's best interests under Companies Act 2006 s.172, with particular consideration to creditors' interests when the company is approaching insolvency. 2. Insolvency Tests: According to Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014] EWCA Civ 383 and Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007], both cash-flow and balance-sheet tests must be considered when determining insolvency. The key question is whether the company was insolvent when you received the loan repayments. 3. Liquidator's Powers: The liquidator has significant powers to investigate and recover payments made before liquidation. Under the Insolvency Act 1986, they can: - Pursue misfeasance claims against directors - Challenge transactions at an undervalue - Seek director disqualification through the relevant authorities 4. Your Specific Situation: While you state the loan was at below-market interest rates, the critical factors are: - The timing of the repayments in relation to the company's insolvency - Whether other creditors were being paid at the time - Whether the company could reasonably continue trading when the payments were made 5. Recommendations: a) Immediate Actions: - Gather all documentation relating to the loan agreement - Collect evidence of the company's financial position when payments were received - Consider seeking professional accounting advice to verify the company's solvency status at relevant times b) Legal Strategy: - Consider negotiating with the liquidator - returning some or all of the payments might be preferable to facing disqualification proceedings - If you believe the payments were legitimate, prepare detailed evidence showing: * The commercial rationale for the loan * The company's solvency at the time of payments * That other creditors were being paid normally c) Risk Assessment: The risk of disqualification is serious, particularly given your current directorship in your sister's company. Under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, disqualification can last up to 15 years. 6. Suggested Course of Action: Given the serious implications, I would recommend: 1. Engaging in constructive dialogue with the liquidator 2. Consider making a reasonable settlement offer 3. If you decide to contest: - Prepare comprehensive documentation - Consider seeking separate counsel for the disqualification threat - Be prepared for potentially lengthy proceedings The case of BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 emphasizes that insolvency must be determined on the balance of probabilities. If you can prove the company was solvent when payments were made, you may have a defense, but the risks of litigation and potential disqualification must be carefully weighed against the cost of settlement. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific guidance on any particular aspect?	15.053479194641113	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 108 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 91 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 6.23 (CREDITORS' VOLUNTARY WINDING UP)	HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch) (Cash flows; Notion of insolvency; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidators' powers and duties; Misfeasance; Payments in insolvency)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Centralcrest Engineering Ltd, Re [1999] 9 W.L.U.K. 176 (Misconduct; Liquidators' duties; Misfeasance; Tortious liability; Trading)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.)

Q9	My business is operating at a loss. Chase Bank is my major lender, and they have a security over my home. I fell into arrears towards several suppliers, but I do believe I can turn around my business if I am given a bit more time to repay my debts. What can I do?	Based on your situation, I'll provide legal advice considering the relevant laws and cases: 1. Assessment of Insolvency Status: According to Cheyne Finance plc (No 2) and Casa Estates, we need to consider both cash-flow and balance-sheet tests to determine your insolvency status. The fact that you're in arrears with suppliers suggests potential cash-flow insolvency, but this isn't definitive if you can demonstrate future ability to pay debts. 2. Options Available: a) Company Moratorium: - Consider applying for a moratorium under the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 - This would give you breathing space from creditor actions - Use Form MT03 when the moratorium ends - This could provide the time you need to restructure and turn around the business b) Negotiation with Creditors: - Following BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail, the court takes a practical approach to assessing inability to pay debts - Engage with Chase Bank regarding your secured debt - Approach suppliers to arrange payment plans 3. Warning Points: a) Director's Duties: - Per BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA, you must consider creditors' interests when the company is approaching insolvency - Be careful about continuing to trade if the situation worsens, as this could lead to wrongful trading (as seen in Re Pure Zanzibar Ltd) b) Creditor Actions: - Under IA 1986 s.123, creditors owed more than £750 can serve a statutory demand - If unpaid for 3 weeks, they could petition for winding up - However, as per Petitioner v Company [2022], if COVID-19 impacted your business, this might provide some protection 4. Recommendations: 1. Seek immediate professional insolvency advice 2. Consider formal restructuring options 3. Document all decisions and rationale to show you're acting responsibly 4. Prepare detailed cash flow forecasts to support your turnaround plan 5. Keep creditors informed of your situation and plans Remember, as highlighted in Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy, mere hopes of future funding aren't sufficient - you need concrete plans and evidence to support your turnaround strategy. If the situation deteriorates, consider whether voluntary arrangements might be more appropriate than continuing to trade. The key is to act promptly while maintaining clear communication with all stakeholders.

Q10	My business went into liquidation last March. I tried my best to avoid it. I may have preferred some creditors over others, but simply because they knew I was struggling, and they would not give me their products on credit. I may also have taken some money out of the business account to repay the mortgage on my house. Surely, I did nothing wrong? Do I risk anything?	As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I must advise you that your actions raise serious concerns under insolvency law. Let me explain the key issues: 1. Preferential Payments Your admission of preferring some creditors over others when you knew the company was struggling could constitute a preference under insolvency law. According to BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016], directors have duties to consider creditors' interests when a company approaches insolvency. Making preferential payments during this period could be challenged by the liquidator. 2. Personal Benefit Using company funds to pay your personal mortgage when the company was in financial difficulty is particularly problematic. This could be considered: - A transaction at an undervalue (as discussed in Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014]) - A breach of fiduciary duty as a director - Potentially fraudulent trading if you knew the company was insolvent 3. Insolvency Test Based on Cheyne Finance plc (No 2) [2007] and BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013], insolvency is determined by both: - Cash flow test: ability to pay debts as they fall due - Balance sheet test: whether assets exceed liabilities 4. Potential Consequences You could face: - Personal liability to repay the funds taken - Disqualification as a director under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 - In serious cases, criminal charges if the actions are deemed fraudulent 5. Legal Obligations Under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986, once you knew the company was unable to pay its debts, you had a duty to act in the interests of creditors as a whole, not to prefer certain creditors or yourself. Recommendation: 1. Seek immediate legal representation 2. Gather all documentation relating to these transactions 3. Cooperate fully with the liquidator 4. Consider voluntary disclosure of these actions to potentially mitigate consequences The principle from Belmont Park Investments [2011] regarding good faith may be relevant to your defense, but only if you can demonstrate that your actions were taken in good faith and with commercial justification, which may be difficult given the personal benefit obtained. Would you like me to provide more specific advice about any of these aspects?	10.914471626281738	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 188 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 247 (Interpretation for First Group of Parts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Marches Credit Union Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 1731 (Ch) (Liquidation; Locus standi; Petitions; Union)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form LIQ06: Use this form to give notice of a liquidator's resignation in members' voluntary liquidation or creditors' voluntary liquidation.|Companies House Form AM22: Use this form to give notice of a move from administration to creditors' voluntary liquidation.
Q11	My life-long partner just left me for an Italian scugnizzo who is 15 years younger than her. What’s worse is that before leaving, she emptied our joint business account and she stopped paying the joint mortgage we have on our business. The bank is threatening legal actions against me, and to foreclose on the business property. What can I do? By the way, I cannot contact my (ex) partner but I believe she’s now in Italy with her new partner.	I understand this is a difficult personal and business situation. Let me provide some legal advice based on the relevant laws and cases: 1. Immediate Concerns: - Your partner's actions in emptying the business account could constitute a transaction at an undervalue under insolvency law, similar to issues discussed in Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice [1995]. - The cessation of mortgage payments puts the business at risk of insolvency under both cash-flow and balance sheet tests (as per Casa Estates (UK) Ltd [2014] and Cheyne Finance [2007]). 2. Legal Options: a) Regarding the Business: - Under IA 1986 s.123, your business may be deemed unable to pay its debts if you cannot meet the mortgage payments - Consider applying for a moratorium to get breathing space (use Form MT03 when needed) - Based on BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013], assess your company's ability to meet liabilities on balance of probabilities b) Regarding Your Partner's Actions: - You may have grounds for legal action regarding the unauthorized withdrawal of business funds - Consider cross-border enforcement given her location in Italy (Re Entertainment Ltd [2016] provides guidance on cross-border insolvency matters) 3. Practical Steps: Immediate Actions: 1. Document all unauthorized transactions 2. Contact your bank to: - Report unauthorized withdrawals - Discuss mortgage payment options 3. Seek immediate legal representation for both: - Business matters - Personal matters regarding joint assets 4. Options for the Business: a) If you wish to continue trading: - Negotiate with the bank for revised payment terms - Consider seeking new investment - Restructure the business b) If business is no longer viable: - Consider voluntary liquidation - Use Form DS01 to strike off the company (if appropriate) - Be aware that under IA 1986 s.124, creditors may petition for winding up 5. Protection Measures: - Document all communications and transactions - Keep detailed records of the business's financial position - Consider seeking a debt relief order under IA 1986 s.251R if personally liable Remember that under BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016], directors have ongoing duties to consider creditors' interests when facing insolvency. Given the complexity of your situation, particularly with international elements, I strongly recommend seeking immediate assistance from both a corporate insolvency practitioner and a family law solicitor to protect your interests and ensure compliance with all legal obligations. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific guidance on any particular aspect?	13.05238389968872	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 251R (Debt relief orders)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 365 (Bankruptcy)	Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice [1995] 1 W.L.R. 1238 (Directors' duties and powers; Misconduct; Transactions at an undervalue)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Re Entertainment Ltd [2016] EWHC 1545 (Ch) (Cross-Border Insolvency; Centre of main interests; Cross-border insolvency; Foreign proceedings)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form DS01: Use this service to apply to strike off a company from the Companies House register.

Q12	After Brexit, I set up a business in the Netherlands. This is a limited liability company. I am the sole director of that company. There are no employees in the Netherlands, just some people I hire occasionally to load and unload the lorries that distribute my products to the rest of Europe. I have now decided to stop selling goods to Europe, because it is not profitable. I want to wind-up the business here in the UK. Can I do it?	As a corporate insolvency lawyer in England, I need to clarify some important points regarding your situation: 1. Jurisdiction Issue: Your company is incorporated in the Netherlands, not in the UK. This means that UK insolvency laws and the Companies Act 2006 do not directly apply to your Dutch company. The winding-up process would need to follow Dutch corporate and insolvency laws. 2. EU Insolvency Regulations: Post-Brexit, while the UK is no longer subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation, your Dutch company remains subject to EU regulations. The main insolvency proceedings would need to be opened in the Netherlands where the company has its registered office and center of main interests (COMI). 3. Cross-Border Considerations: If your company has assets in the UK, you might need to consider cross-border insolvency proceedings. However, the primary winding-up process must be initiated in the Netherlands. Key Recommendations: 1. Seek Dutch Legal Advice: You should consult with a Dutch insolvency practitioner or lawyer who can guide you through the local winding-up procedures. 2. Asset Distribution: While cases like Prest v Petrodel [2013] UKSC 34 deal with corporate veil issues, they're less relevant here as this is a straightforward winding-up of a foreign company. 3. Director's Duties: As a director, you must comply with Dutch corporate law regarding director's duties during insolvency. The principles in McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) about director's duties and misfeasance, while not directly applicable, highlight the importance of proper conduct during winding-up. 4. UK Assets: If you have any UK assets or business operations, you may need to consider secondary proceedings in the UK, but this would be subsidiary to the main Dutch proceedings. The UK Companies House forms (IC01, RR02, MR06) are not relevant in this case as they apply only to UK-registered companies. I recommend: 1. Consulting a Dutch lawyer immediately 2. Preparing a full asset and liability schedule 3. Ensuring compliance with Dutch insolvency laws 4. Considering any cross-border implications if you have UK assets Would you like me to provide more specific information about any of these aspects?	13.407459020614624	1	Companies Act 2006 section 3 (General introductory provisions)|Companies Act 2006 section 58 (A company's name)|Companies Act 2006 section 59 (A company's name)	Bristol Airport Plc v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744 (Administration; Liens; Security)|Prest v Petrodel Resources Ltd [2013] UKSC 34 (Piercing the corporate veil; Limited liability)|McTear v Eade [2019] EWHC 1673 (Ch) (Breach of fiduciary duty; Directors' duties and powers; Limited liability partnerships; Liquidation; Misfeasance)	Companies House Form IC01: Us this form to give notice of the intention to carry on business as an investment company.|Companies House Form RR02: This form is for public companies to re-register as a private limited company.|Companies House Form MR06: Use this form to register a statement of a company acting as a trustee after a charge created on or after 6 April 2013 has been registered.
