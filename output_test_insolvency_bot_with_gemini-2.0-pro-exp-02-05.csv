Q1	I set up a limited liability company in 2015. My business suffered greatly during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it still hasnâ€™t recovered yet. I fell into arrears, and one of my suppliers submitted a winding-up petition against my business. A friend of mine is willing to invest money in my company. Do I have good chances of avoiding a liquidation order if my friend commits to pumping money into my business?	"Okay, let's break down your situation and discuss your options. Here's a legal perspective on your predicament, incorporating relevant laws and case precedents: **Understanding the Core Issues** 1. **Winding-Up Petition:** A winding-up petition, as per Section 124 of the Insolvency Act 1986, is a serious legal action taken by a creditor (your supplier) to force your company into compulsory liquidation. This is because they believe your company is unable to pay its debts. 2. **Inability to Pay Debts:** The court will assess your company's solvency based on the criteria outlined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986. There are two main tests: * **Cash Flow Test (s.123(1)(e)):** Can your company pay its debts as they fall due? This doesn't just mean right now, but also in the reasonably near future. The case of *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)* clarified that future debts are considered. * **Balance Sheet Test (s.123(2)):** Are your company's assets less than its liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities? This is a broader assessment of your company's overall financial position. *BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28* confirmed that this is assessed on the balance of probabilities. *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383* emphasized that both the cash flow and balance sheet test are applied. 3. **COVID-19 Impact:** The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (CIGA 2020) introduced temporary measures to protect businesses affected by the pandemic. However, these provisions have largely expired. Relevant case law, such as *Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch)*, shows that you'll need *strong evidence* to prove that COVID-19 is the *direct cause* of your current inability to pay debts, and that your business wasn't already failing. Simply saying the pandemic affected you isn't enough. Also, *Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131* demonstrated that a petitioner needs to show that the Company would be would up, even if coronavirus had not had an adverse financial effect. 4. **Potential Investment:** Your friend's offer of investment is a crucial factor, but it's not a guaranteed solution. **Analyzing Your Chances** Based on the information provided, here's a realistic assessment: * **The Challenge:** The biggest hurdle is proving to the court that your company is *not* insolvent (either on a cash flow or balance sheet basis) *or* that a winding-up order isn't the best outcome for creditors. The burden of proof is on you. * **The Investment's Impact:** The mere *promise* of future funding is unlikely to be sufficient. The court, as established in *Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986)*, will dismiss ""hopes and expectations"" without concrete evidence. You need to demonstrate: * **Binding Commitment:** A legally binding agreement from your friend is essential. This could be a shareholder agreement, a loan agreement, or a subscription agreement for new shares. Vague promises or letters of intent are insufficient. * **Sufficient Funds:** The investment must be substantial enough to demonstrably improve your company's financial position. It needs to cover existing debts (including the one owed to the petitioner) and provide working capital for the foreseeable future. * **Credible Business Plan:** You need a realistic and detailed business plan showing how the investment will be used to turn the company around and make it viable in the long term. This plan should include: * Market analysis (showing demand for your product/service) * Financial projections (revenue, expenses, profit) * Operational strategy (how you'll overcome the challenges) * Evidence that COVID-19's impact is diminishing or manageable. * **Negotiation with the Petitioner:** Before the court hearing, it's highly advisable to try to negotiate with your supplier. If you can present a credible plan backed by the investment, they might agree to withdraw the petition, perhaps in exchange for a payment plan. This is often the best outcome. **Possible Strategies and Actions** 1. **Immediate Legal Advice:** Do not delay in consulting with a solicitor who is experienced in insolvency and winding-up petitions. This is crucial for assessing your specific situation and building the strongest possible defense. 2. **Gather Evidence:** Compile all relevant financial records, including: * Bank statements * Accounts payable and receivable ledgers * Management accounts * Tax returns * Contracts with suppliers and customers * Any evidence directly linking your financial difficulties to COVID-19 (e.g., government-mandated closures, supply chain disruptions). 3. **Formalize the Investment:** Work with your solicitor to create a legally binding agreement with your friend. This agreement should clearly specify: * The amount of the investment * The form of the investment (loan, equity, etc.) * The terms of repayment (if applicable) * Any conditions attached to the investment 4. **Prepare a Detailed Business Plan:** This is crucial for demonstrating the viability of your company with the new investment. 5. **Consider a Moratorium (Less Likely):** While a moratorium under Section A4 of the Insolvency Act 1986 *could* provide breathing space, it's designed for companies that have a realistic prospect of rescue *and* would achieve a better result for creditors than immediate winding up. Given that a winding-up petition has already been presented, and you must demonstrate that it's better than liquidation, it's a high bar. The directors would apply to the court, supported by the ""relevant documents"" outlined in Section A6. 6. **Explore other insolvency proceedures.** If it transpires that the Company is unable to avoid a Winding-up order, it is best to understand your other options, such as Voluntary Liquidation. **Potential Risks and Consequences** * **Winding-Up Order:** If the court is not satisfied, it will issue a winding-up order. This means: * A liquidator will be appointed to take control of your company. * Your company's assets will be sold to pay off creditors. * Your company will cease to exist. * **Director Disqualification:** If there's evidence of misconduct or unfit conduct in the way you managed the company, you could be disqualified from acting as a director for a period of time under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. * **Personal Liability:** While limited liability protects you in most cases, there are circumstances where directors can be held personally liable for company debts, particularly if there's evidence of wrongful trading (continuing to trade when you knew or should have known the company was insolvent) or fraudulent trading. * **Offences Under Insolvency Act.** Section 208, makes it an offence to, for example, not provide the liquidator with all of the company's information. **Key Takeaways** * **Act quickly and seek professional legal advice immediately.** * **A friend's promise to invest is not enough; it must be legally binding and substantial.** * **You need a robust business plan demonstrating future viability.** * **Negotiation with the petitioner is crucial.** * **Be prepared for the possibility of a winding-up order and understand the potential consequences.** * **Focus on providing concrete evidence, not just hopes or assertions.** This advice is for general guidance only and does not constitute legal advice. Your specific circumstances require a detailed review by a qualified solicitor.

Q2	My business has been running at a deficit for a few years. In 2021, I got a loan from NatWest to stay afloat. I have given my share in the family home (50%) as a collateral for this loan. I am now unable to repay it. What should I do? Can the bank repossess my house?	"Okay, here's some advice based on the information you've provided, keeping in mind I'm acting as a corporate insolvency lawyer in England: **1. Understanding Your Situation: Key Concerns** * **Insolvency:** Your business running at a deficit for several years, coupled with your inability to repay the NatWest loan, strongly suggests your company is insolvent, or at the very least, at high risk of becoming insolvent. We need to determine *which* definition of insolvency applies, as this impacts the available options and legal consequences. * **Secured Debt:** NatWest has a secured loan, with your 50% share of the family home as collateral. This means they have a priority claim over that asset. * **Potential Personal Liability:** Depending on how your business is structured (limited company, LLP, sole trader), your personal liability for the business debts differs significantly. The fact that you've used your personal home as collateral means your personal assets *are* at risk, regardless of the business structure. * **Directors' Duties (If Applicable):** If your business is a limited company or LLP, you have directors' duties. Failing to act in the best interests of creditors when a company is insolvent or nearing insolvency can lead to personal liability for wrongful trading or misfeasance. **2. Determining the Business Structure** Before I can give more specific advice, I *must* know how your business is structured: * **Sole Trader:** If you're a sole trader, there's no legal distinction between you and your business. You are *personally* liable for all business debts. The NatWest loan secured against your home puts your home directly at risk. * **Partnership (General Partnership):** Similar to a sole trader, partners in a general partnership have unlimited liability. You and your partners are jointly and severally liable for the business debts. Your home is at risk. * **Limited Liability Partnership (LLP):** LLPs offer limited liability to their members *except* where personal guarantees (like using your home as collateral) have been given. The loan situation puts your home at risk, but your other personal assets *might* be protected (depending on the loan terms). *McTear v Eade [2019]* is relevant here, as drawings taken from an LLP in anticipation of profits that never materialize can be considered misfeasance. * **Limited Company:** A limited company offers the strongest protection of personal assets. Generally, your liability is limited to the amount you've invested in the company. *However*, the personal guarantee on the NatWest loan *overrides* this limited liability to the extent of the secured amount. Your home is at risk. Furthermore, as a director, you have significant duties, particularly when the company is facing insolvency. **3. Assessing Insolvency** We need to determine if your company is insolvent, and if so, under which definition: * **Cash Flow Insolvency:** This is the most common test. Are you unable to pay your debts as they fall due? The fact you can't repay the NatWest loan is a strong indicator. *Insolvency Act 1986, section 123(1)(e)* directly addresses this. *Rowntree Ventures Ltd v Oak Property Partners Ltd [2016]* also discusses this test. * **Balance Sheet Insolvency:** Are your company's liabilities greater than its assets? *Insolvency Act 1986, section 123(2)* covers this. This takes into account contingent and prospective liabilities (like potential lawsuits or future obligations). *Johnson v Beighton [2019]* highlights the importance of not using hindsight when assessing balance sheet insolvency. **4. Your Options (and Their Implications)** The best option depends on the business structure and the precise financial situation. Here's a breakdown, and I'll tailor it once I know your business structure: * **Negotiation with NatWest:** This is the *first* step, regardless of other options. Contact NatWest *immediately*. Explain your situation. They may be willing to: * Extend the loan term. * Reduce payments temporarily. * Agree to a payment plan. * Explore other options to avoid enforcing the security. * Be open and honest. Hiding the problem will make it worse. * **Formal Insolvency Procedures (if applicable, i.e., not a sole trader):** * **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** This is a formal agreement with creditors to pay back a portion of your debts over time (typically 3-5 years). It requires 75% (by value) of creditors voting in favor to approve it. It allows the company to continue trading. Section 899A will apply. * **Administration:** An administrator (an insolvency practitioner) takes control of the company to try to rescue it as a going concern, or if that's not possible, to achieve a better result for creditors than liquidation. *Rowntree Ventures Ltd [2016]* shows that even if the conditions for administration are met, the court may not grant it if it's not appropriate. * **Liquidation (Winding Up):** This is the end of the company. Assets are sold, and proceeds are distributed to creditors according to a strict order of priority. A liquidator is appointed. * **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** The directors recognize the company is insolvent and initiate the process. * **Compulsory Liquidation:** A creditor (like NatWest) petitions the court to wind up the company. *Insolvency Act 1986, section 124* details who can petition for winding up. *Petitioner v Company [2022]* is a recent case showing that winding-up petitions related to COVID-19 debts have specific requirements. * **Moratorium:** A short-term breathing space from creditor action, giving you time to explore rescue options. This is often used before a CVA. * **Informal Arrangements:** If your debts are relatively small, you might be able to negotiate informal repayment plans with your creditors. * **If you are a Sole Trader** * **Individual Voluntary Arrangement:** The personal equivalent of a Company Voluntary Arrangement. * **Bankruptcy:** Declaring bankruptcy. * **Debt relief order** **5. Directors' Duties and Potential Liabilities (For Limited Companies and LLPs)** * **Duty to Act in the Best Interests of Creditors:** Once a company is insolvent, or *knows or ought to know* it is bordering on insolvency, the directors' primary duty shifts from shareholders to creditors. This is crucial. *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2022]* (Supreme Court) is the leading case on this ""creditor duty."" The earlier *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016]* case provides context. * **Wrongful Trading (Insolvency Act 1986, s.214):** If you continue to trade while knowing (or when you *should* have known) there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation, you can be held personally liable for the company's debts incurred during that period. *Johnson v Beighton [2019]* and *Singer v Beckett [2001]* are important cases on wrongful trading. * **Misfeasance (Insolvency Act 1986, s.212):** This is a breach of duty by a director, such as misapplying company money or assets. *McTear v Eade [2019]* is a key example related to drawings in anticipation of profits. *Singer v Beckett [2001]* also touches on misfeasance. * **Fraudulent Trading (Insolvency Act 1986, s.213):** This is a more serious offence, involving intent to defraud creditors. *Morris v Bank of India [2004]* addresses fraudulent trading. * **Transactions at an Undervalue (Insolvency Act 1986, s.238):** If you've transferred company assets for less than their value, this can be challenged by a liquidator. *Pathania v Tashie-Lewis [2021]* highlights the need for clear evidence in such cases. * **Director Disqualification:** If your conduct as a director is deemed unfit, you can be disqualified from acting as a director for a period of up to 15 years. *Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988]* and *Official Receiver v Arron [2021]* are important cases on director disqualification. **6. Can the Bank Repossess Your House?** Yes, NatWest can ultimately repossess your house, but it is a process. Because your share of your family home has been provided as collateral, NatWest can begin with the following: * Issuing a statutory demand. * Applying to court to have the business wound up. Because the debt is secured on your house, the process is broadly: 1. **Default Notice:** NatWest will issue a formal default notice, demanding repayment. 2. **Legal Action:** If you don't pay, they will likely start legal proceedings to enforce the security. 3. **Court Order:** They'll need a court order for possession of your home. 4. **Eviction:** If the court grants the order, you will be given a date to leave. Bailiffs can be used to enforce the eviction. **7. Immediate Steps You Should Take** 1. **Gather Information:** Collect all relevant documents: * Loan agreement with NatWest. * Business accounts (profit & loss, balance sheet, cash flow statements). * Details of all other creditors. * Documents related to your business structure. * Any correspondence with NatWest. 2. **Contact NatWest:** As mentioned above, open communication is crucial. 3. **Seek Professional Advice:** You *urgently* need advice from an insolvency practitioner (IP) *and* a solicitor specializing in insolvency. An IP can assess your financial situation and advise on the best options. The solicitor can advise on the legal aspects, including directors' duties and potential liabilities. Do *not* delay this. 4. **Consider Your Options Carefully:** Don't rush into any decisions. Understand the implications of each option before proceeding. 5. **Be realistic:** This is a very difficult time, but the legal advice you have been given is sound. **Important Disclaimer:** This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute legal advice. You must seek professional legal advice tailored to your specific circumstances. I have provided general information but a solicitor instructed by you will be able to advise you.

Q3	My business (a small restaurant in Egham) is saddled with debt towards several suppliers. I do have a loyal customer base, but I feel that I need to reduce my debt burden. My brother offered to buy my business for a fair price, and he also told me he would like to retain me and some of my employees. However, he says that I need to deal with my debt before selling the business to him. I donâ€™t have savings. What can I do?	"Okay, let's break down your situation and explore some potential options. It's good that you're thinking proactively about this, and it's also positive that your brother is interested in buying the business and retaining staff. Here's some advice, framed within the context of English corporate insolvency law: **1. Assessing Your Insolvency Situation** The first crucial step is to determine whether your business is, in fact, insolvent. There are two primary tests, and as per *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383*, both need to be considered: * **Cash Flow Test (Insolvency Act 1986, s.123(1)(e)):** Can your restaurant pay its debts as they fall due? This isn't just about debts that are currently due; it also includes *prospective* debts, as highlighted in *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)*. So, you need to look at your upcoming supplier bills, rent, wages, etc., and realistically assess if you can meet them. * **Balance Sheet Test (Insolvency Act 1986, s.123(2)):** Are the total liabilities of your restaurant (including contingent and prospective liabilities) greater than its assets? *BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28* clarified that this is assessed on the balance of probabilities. You'll need to value your assets (equipment, leasehold, goodwill, etc.) and compare them to your debts (supplier debts, loans, etc.). It is important to consider that hopes and expectations of future funding without any rights to those assets are irrelevant (*Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986)*). It sounds like you're leaning towards insolvency, given your statement about being ""saddled with debt."" However, a formal assessment is vital. **2. Options to Consider** Given your brother's offer and your desire to continue the business (even if under new ownership), here are some potential paths, ranging from informal to formal insolvency procedures: * **A. Informal Negotiations with Creditors:** * **What it is:** Directly contacting your suppliers and explaining your situation. You could propose a payment plan, requesting more time to pay or a temporary reduction in payments. * **Pros:** This is the least disruptive option. It maintains your relationship with suppliers, which might be crucial if your brother wants to continue working with them. * **Cons:** It relies entirely on the goodwill of your creditors. There's no legal protection, and if one creditor refuses and starts legal action (like issuing a statutory demand, as discussed below), it can trigger a cascade. * **Legal Relevance:** This is about contract negotiation and good faith. * **B. Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** * **What it is:** A formal, legally binding agreement with your creditors to pay back a portion of your debts over a set period (typically 3-5 years). An insolvency practitioner (IP) supervises the CVA. * **Pros:** * It binds *all* unsecured creditors (even those who vote against it) if a sufficient majority (75% by value of those voting) agree. * It provides breathing space from creditor action (a moratorium, under Insolvency Act 1986, s.A16). * The business can continue to trade. * It's often a better outcome for creditors than liquidation. * Your brother could potentially purchase the business *after* the CVA is approved, providing the funds to make the CVA payments. * **Cons:** * It requires the involvement of an IP, which incurs costs. * It needs creditor approval, which isn't guaranteed. * It's a public process (details are filed at Companies House). * It doesn't bind secured creditors (e.g., a bank with a charge over your equipment). * **Legal Relevance:** Governed by the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016. The CVA proposal must be realistic and offer a better return to creditors than liquidation. * **C. Administration:** * **What it is:** An insolvency practitioner (the administrator) takes control of the company to achieve one of three statutory objectives: 1. Rescuing the company as a going concern (this is the primary objective). 2. Achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in administration). 3. Realising property in order to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. * **Pros:** * Provides a strong moratorium on creditor action (Insolvency Act 1986, Schedule B1). * The administrator has broad powers to manage the business and restructure it. * A ""pre-pack"" administration is possible (see below). * **Cons:** * You lose control of the business. * It's a more expensive process than a CVA. * It can have a negative impact on the business's reputation. * **Legal Relevance:** Governed by the Insolvency Act 1986, Schedule B1. * **D. Pre-Pack Administration:** * **What it is:** A specific type of administration where the sale of the business (or its assets) is agreed upon *before* the administrator is appointed, and the sale is completed immediately or shortly after the appointment. This is often used when a buyer (like your brother) is already lined up. * **Pros:** * Speed and efficiency â€“ the business can transition to new ownership quickly, minimizing disruption. * Preserves value â€“ avoids the potential loss of value that can occur during a prolonged insolvency process. * Can preserve jobs â€“ your brother's intention to retain employees aligns well with this. * **Cons:** * It has faced criticism for potentially lacking transparency and favoring connected parties (like your brother). Strict rules and guidelines (SIP 16) govern pre-packs to ensure fairness and maximize returns for creditors. The administrator *must* act in the best interests of the creditors as a whole. * Requires careful planning and execution to avoid legal challenges. * **Legal Relevance:** Governed by the Insolvency Act 1986, Schedule B1, and Statement of Insolvency Practice 16 (SIP 16). The *Belmont Park* case is relevant here: even if the sale to your brother might look like it's depriving creditors (because the company's assets are being sold), if it's done in good faith, for a fair price, and with commercial sense, it's unlikely to be invalidated by the anti-deprivation principle. * **E. Liquidation (Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation - CVL):** * **What it is:** This is the process of winding up the company's affairs, selling its assets, and distributing the proceeds to creditors according to a strict order of priority. An IP acts as the liquidator. This is initiated by the company's shareholders. * **Pros:** * It brings a definitive end to the company's debts. * It's a relatively straightforward process (though still complex legally). * **Cons:** * The business ceases to trade. * Employees are typically made redundant (though your brother's offer mitigates this somewhat). * Creditors often receive only a small percentage of what they're owed. * Directors can face investigation and potential disqualification (see below). * **Legal Relevance:** Governed by the Insolvency Act 1986 (sections relevant to winding up, such as s.122, s.123, s.124, and s.149). **3. Key Considerations and Warnings** * **Statutory Demand:** Be aware that any creditor owed more than Â£750 can serve a statutory demand (Insolvency Act 1986, s.123(1)(a)). If you don't pay or reach an agreement within three weeks, the creditor can petition for your company's winding up. This is a serious threat and should be avoided if possible. * **Director's Duties:** As a director, you have legal duties (Companies Act 2006, s.172). While the company is solvent, these duties are primarily to the shareholders. However, when the company is insolvent, or *close to insolvency*, your duties shift to prioritizing the interests of the *creditors*. *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)* is important here. You must not take actions that worsen the position of creditors. * **Wrongful Trading:** If you continue to trade while knowing the company is insolvent and there's no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation, you could be liable for wrongful trading (Insolvency Act 1986, s.214). This can lead to personal liability for the company's debts. * **Transactions at an Undervalue & Preferences:** Be *extremely* careful about any transactions before a formal insolvency process. If you sell assets for less than their true value (a ""transaction at an undervalue,"" Insolvency Act 1986, s.238) or favor one creditor over others (a ""preference,"" Insolvency Act 1986, s.239), these transactions can be challenged and reversed by an IP. This is crucial in the context of your brother's offer. The sale *must* be at a fair market value, and the process should be transparent. * **Director Disqualification:** The Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 allows for the disqualification of directors for unfit conduct, which can include breaches of duty, wrongful trading, and other insolvency-related offenses. * **Coronavirus Impact:** Although less relevant now than in 2022, the case of *Petitioner v Company [2022] 6 WLUK 131* highlights that the impact of the pandemic was a factor in winding-up petitions. While this case is specific to its facts, it's a reminder that external factors can be considered. **4. Recommended Steps** 1. **Get Professional Advice Immediately:** Contact a qualified insolvency practitioner (IP) and a solicitor specializing in insolvency law. They can assess your situation, advise you on the best course of action, and guide you through the legal complexities. This is *absolutely essential* to protect yourself and your brother. 2. **Full and Frank Disclosure:** Be completely open and honest with the IP and solicitor about your financial position, the proposed sale to your brother, and any other relevant information. 3. **Valuation:** Obtain an independent valuation of the restaurant's assets (including goodwill) to ensure that any sale to your brother is at a fair market price. This is crucial to avoid accusations of a transaction at an undervalue. 4. **Consider a Pre-Pack:** Given your brother's interest, a pre-pack administration is likely the most suitable option, *provided* it's done correctly and transparently. The IP will need to be satisfied that it's the best outcome for creditors. 5. **Document Everything:** Keep meticulous records of all communications, decisions, and transactions related to the business and its debts. **Forms:** While you mentioned some Companies House forms, they are not immediately relevant to your *initial* steps. Form LIQ02 (statement of affairs) is used in liquidation, MR03 is for registering charges (not relevant here), and RT01 is for company restoration (the opposite of what you're considering).

Q4	I own a pub in Windsor. I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, by additional taxes on alcohol as well as by a reduction in my customer base. I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). I reached an agreement with my bank and with most of my suppliers to delay the repayment of my debt. The HMRC wonâ€™t listen and they are threatening legal actions against me. What can I do? HMRC counts for roughly 50% of my unsecured debt (the debt towards the bank is secured by a collateral on my pub).	"Okay, here's some legal advice tailored to your situation, incorporating the relevant legislation, case law, and practical steps: **Understanding Your Situation** You're facing significant financial difficulties, primarily driven by external factors (interest rates, taxes, reduced customer base) and are struggling with debt, particularly to HMRC. You've taken some proactive steps by negotiating with your bank and some suppliers, but HMRC is proving uncooperative and represents a substantial portion (50%) of your unsecured debt. The secured debt to your bank is less immediately problematic, as long as you can continue servicing those payments, given the collateral. **Immediate Concerns and Potential Risks** * **HMRC's Threat of Legal Action:** This is the most pressing issue. HMRC can issue a statutory demand and, if you fail to pay within three weeks, they can present a winding-up petition under s.124 of the Insolvency Act 1986. This could lead to the compulsory liquidation of your pub business. * **Inability to Pay Debts:** It sounds like you're potentially ""insolvent,"" but we need to define that precisely. The law uses two main tests (as per *Casa Estates* and *Cheyne Finance*): * **Cash Flow Test (s.123(1)(e) IA 1986):** Can you pay your debts *as they fall due*? This includes consideration of future debts, not just current ones (*Cheyne Finance*). * **Balance Sheet Test (s.123(2) IA 1986):** Are your assets less than your liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities? (*BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail*). The burden of proving balance sheet insolvency lies on the party asserting it. * **Director's Duties:** As a director, you have duties under the Companies Act 2006. Crucially, s.172 requires you to act in good faith to promote the success of the company. When a company is *nearing* insolvency, this duty shifts to include consideration of the interests of creditors (*BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA*). Making preferential payments to some suppliers while neglecting others (like HMRC) *could* be seen as a breach of this duty if your company is indeed insolvent or close to it, unless those payments are demonstrably essential to keep the business running. * **Wrongful Trading:** If you continue to trade while knowing that there is no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation, you could be liable for wrongful trading under s.214 Insolvency Act 1986. **Possible Courses of Action** Here's a breakdown of your options, starting with the most urgent: 1. **Negotiate with HMRC (Again):** This is *always* the first step. Even if previous attempts have failed, try again. Emphasize: * The steps you've taken to manage other debts. * Your willingness to enter into a formal payment plan (Time to Pay Arrangement). * The impact of closure on local employment and the community. * Provide HMRC with a detailed, realistic cash flow forecast. 2. **Formal Insolvency Procedures:** * **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** This is a formal agreement with your creditors to repay a portion of your debts over time (typically 3-5 years). It requires the approval of 75% (by value) of your *unsecured* creditors voting in each class. * **Key Advantage:** It allows you to continue trading and potentially avoid liquidation. It binds all unsecured creditors, *including HMRC*, if the required majority approves it. * **Key Disadvantage:** It doesn't bind secured creditors (your bank) without their consent. Your secured debt to your bank will remain unaffected. * **Relevance of Companies Act 2006, s.899A:** Because you've recently been negotiating with creditors and some may have moratorium debts or priority pre-moratorium debts (though it sounds like the moratorium provisions are more relevant to formal moratoriums under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, not informal agreements), it is important to check if the CVA meets the requirements of the creditors. * **Moratorium:** You could consider applying for a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986. This gives you breathing space from creditor action (including HMRC) while you explore a CVA or other rescue options. It's a relatively new procedure, and the moratorium itself has specific rules about payments you can and can't make (s.A28 IA 1986). You would need a licensed insolvency practitioner to act as a monitor. They would need to assess whether a CVA is likely to be successful. Relevant Companies House Forms include MT02 (extension of moratorium) and MT03 (early termination of moratorium). If the court makes an order on the moratorium, Companies House Form MT09 is relevant. * **Administration:** This involves appointing an administrator (a licensed insolvency practitioner) who takes control of the company. The administrator's primary objective is to rescue the company as a going concern. If that's not possible, they aim to achieve a better result for creditors than liquidation. * **Key Advantage:** Provides strong protection from creditor action (including HMRC) via a statutory moratorium. * **Key Disadvantage:** You lose control of the business. * **Liquidation:** This is the last resort. It involves winding up the company, selling its assets, and distributing the proceeds to creditors according to the statutory order of priority. * **Key Disadvantage:** Your business ceases to exist. You may face investigation by the liquidator and potential disqualification as a director under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 if there's evidence of misconduct. 3. **Debt Relief Order (DRO):** This is *not* applicable to companies. DROs are for individuals with relatively low levels of debt and assets (Insolvency Act 1986, s.251G). 4. **Informal agreements with all creditors**: Given that HMRC is being difficult, this option is not suitable. **Key Legal Considerations** * **Statutory Demand:** If HMRC serves a statutory demand, you have *very* limited time to respond (21 days). Failure to pay, secure the debt, or apply to set aside the demand within this period allows HMRC to proceed with a winding-up petition. * **Winding-Up Petition (s.124 IA 1986):** If HMRC presents a petition, the court will consider whether the company is unable to pay its debts (s.123 IA 1986). The court will look at both the cash flow and balance sheet tests. Mere hopes of future funding are not enough (*Byblos Bank*). * **Anti-Deprivation Principle:** This principle prevents contracts from removing assets from the company on insolvency to the detriment of creditors. However, *Belmont Park* clarified that this principle is applied with commercial sense and good faith in mind. Your existing agreements with the bank and suppliers are unlikely to be affected unless they were specifically designed to evade insolvency laws. Your agreement with your bank is unlikely to fall foul of this rule, because security has been granted. **Recommended Steps** 1. **Immediate Action:** * **Engage a Licensed Insolvency Practitioner (IP):** This is crucial. An IP can assess your financial position accurately, advise on the best course of action, and negotiate with HMRC on your behalf. * **Prepare Detailed Financial Information:** Gather all relevant documents, including bank statements, loan agreements, supplier contracts, tax demands, and up-to-date management accounts. * **Cash Flow Forecast:** Create a realistic short-term and medium-term cash flow forecast. 2. **Next Steps (Depending on IP's Advice):** * **Formal Negotiation with HMRC:** The IP can lead this, aiming for a Time to Pay Arrangement. * **Explore CVA:** If feasible, this is likely the best option to keep your business running. The IP will help prepare the proposal and convene the creditors' meeting. * **Consider Moratorium:** If a CVA is a realistic prospect, a moratorium can provide valuable breathing space. * **Prepare for Potential Winding-Up Petition:** If HMRC is intransigent, you need to be prepared for a petition. This means gathering evidence to demonstrate (if possible) that you *are* able to pay your debts, or that a CVA is a viable alternative. **Important Disclaimer:** This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute formal legal advice. Your situation is complex, and you *must* seek advice from a qualified insolvency lawyer and a licensed insolvency practitioner as soon as possible. They can provide specific advice tailored to your circumstances and represent your interests effectively. Do not delay seeking professional help.

Q5	I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, as well as by a reduction in my customer base (I run a pub in Ascot). I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). My landlord is demanding an extortionate amount of money for my rent. While I agreed to a new, 5-year leasing agreement, I realised that I am operating at a loss unless my rent is reduced and the HMRC agrees to a repayment plan. What can I do?	"Okay, here's a breakdown of your situation and potential legal options, drawing on the provided information and my understanding of English corporate insolvency law: **I. Understanding Your Situation â€“ Key Issues** You're facing multiple pressures common to struggling businesses: * **Increased Debt Burden:** Rising interest rates on your loans are a significant factor. * **Reduced Revenue:** A shrinking customer base directly impacts your ability to meet financial obligations. * **Cash Flow Problems:** Arrears with HMRC and suppliers indicate a serious cash flow crisis. Prioritizing some suppliers was a necessary short-term survival tactic, but unsustainable. * **High Rent:** The landlord's demands, coupled with the new lease, are making the business unprofitable. * **Loss-Making Operation:** You're operating at a loss, meaning you're digging a deeper hole each month. **II. Immediate Concerns and Potential Risks** 1. **HMRC Arrears:** HMRC is a preferential creditor in insolvency. They have significant powers to enforce debt collection, including issuing statutory demands and ultimately winding-up petitions. This is a very serious threat. 2. **Landlord Action:** Your landlord could potentially forfeit the lease (terminate it) for non-payment of rent, leading to the loss of your premises and business. They could also pursue legal action to recover the arrears. 3. **Supplier Pressure:** While you've managed to keep some suppliers onside, continued non-payment to others could lead to legal action and further disruption. 4. **Director's Duties:** As a director, you have legal duties under the Companies Act 2006. Crucially, as your company's financial situation worsens, your duties shift from primarily serving the interests of shareholders to considering the interests of creditors (as per *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA*). Failure to do so could lead to personal liability for wrongful trading or misfeasance. **III. Potential Legal Options and Advice** Here's a breakdown of options, from less formal to more formal insolvency procedures: **A. Informal Negotiations and Restructuring** 1. **HMRC Time to Pay Arrangement (TTP):** Contact HMRC *immediately*. Explain your situation and propose a realistic repayment plan. HMRC often prefers TTP arrangements to formal insolvency proceedings if they believe you have a viable business. This is your top priority. 2. **Landlord Negotiations:** Attempt to negotiate a rent reduction, even temporarily. Highlight the long-term benefit to the landlord of having a paying tenant (even at a reduced rate) versus an empty property. Be prepared to provide financial information to support your case. 3. **Supplier Negotiations:** Communicate openly with your suppliers. Explain your situation and propose payment plans where possible. Maintaining good relationships is crucial. **B. Formal Insolvency Procedures** If informal negotiations fail, you need to consider formal options: 1. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** * **What it is:** A CVA is a legally binding agreement with your creditors to repay a portion of your debts over a set period (usually 3-5 years). It allows you to continue trading. * **How it works:** You'll need to work with an Insolvency Practitioner (IP) to develop a CVA proposal. This proposal must be approved by creditors representing at least 75% (by value) of the voting creditors. If approved, it binds all unsecured creditors, including HMRC. * **Pros:** Avoids winding up, allows you to continue trading, gives you breathing space from creditors. * **Cons:** Requires creditor approval, involves IP fees, may not bind secured creditors (like your lender with security over your assets), and the landlord can still forfeit the lease, but there would be a moratorium that would protect you. A CVA could offer a compromise with regard to the rent. * *Relevance of Oceanfill*: While a CVA can restructure your debt to the landlord, it's crucial to understand that if you have any guarantors on the lease (e.g., a personal guarantee), the *Oceanfill* case clarifies that the CVA will *not* release them from their liability. The landlord could still pursue them for the full rent. 2. **Administration:** * **What it is:** An administrator (an IP) takes control of the company to achieve a better outcome for creditors than immediate liquidation. * **How it works:** The administrator has a range of powers, including selling the business as a going concern, restructuring the company, or realizing assets. * **Pros:** Provides a moratorium (a legal pause) on creditor action, including landlord forfeiture and legal proceedings. Gives the administrator time to assess the situation and implement a plan. * **Cons:** You lose control of the company, it can be expensive, and it may not be suitable if the business is fundamentally unviable. * **Moratorium:** A key benefit of administration is the moratorium. You can apply for a moratorium (Form MT03 is relevant if a moratorium ends early, but you'd be applying for one to begin). 3. **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** * **What it is:** This is a formal process where the company's assets are realized and distributed to creditors, and the company is then dissolved. It's initiated by the directors and shareholders. * **How it works:** You appoint an IP as liquidator. The liquidator's duty is to maximize returns for creditors. * **Pros:** It's a controlled way to end the company's operations, deals with creditor claims, and can limit further losses. * **Cons:** The business ceases to trade, you lose your investment, and there may be investigations into your conduct as a director. * **Relevant Forms:** Form LIQ03 (progress report in voluntary winding up) would be used by the liquidator during the process. 4. **Compulsory Liquidation (Winding Up by the Court):** * **What it is:** This is where a creditor (often HMRC) petitions the court to wind up the company due to unpaid debts. * **How it works:** If a creditor serves a statutory demand (under Insolvency Act 1986, s.222, as you've provided â€“ the threshold is Â£750), and you don't pay within 3 weeks, they can petition for winding up. Section 224 also outlines other circumstances in which an unregistered company (though yours is likely registered) is deemed unable to pay its debts. * **Pros:** None for you, really. It's a last resort for creditors. * **Cons:** You lose all control, the company is wound up, and there's a high risk of investigation into your conduct. 5. Company Restoration * What it is: If your company is struck off the Companies Register, there might be options to restore it. * How it works: If the company was struck off, then you could apply to restore it to the register by filling out Companies House Form RT01. * Pros: Allows for the company to be fully restored as if it were never struck off the register. * Cons: The company may have been struck off the register for a reason, and the same issues may repeat themselves. **IV. Director's Duties and Potential Liabilities** * **Shadow Directors:** Be mindful of who might be considered a ""shadow director"" (Companies Act 2006, s.251). If someone exerts significant influence over your decisions, they could also face director liabilities. * **Wrongful Trading:** If you continue to trade while knowing the company is insolvent and there's no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation, you could be liable for wrongful trading. This means you could be personally liable for the company's debts incurred during that period. * **Misfeasance:** This involves breaches of your fiduciary duties as a director (e.g., acting in bad faith, not prioritizing creditor interests when required). * **Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986:** If your conduct as a director is found to be unfit, you could be disqualified from acting as a director for a period of time. * *Belmont Park* Relevance: While the *Belmont Park* case deals with the anti-deprivation principle, it highlights the importance of ""good faith"" and ""commercial sense."" If you can demonstrate that your actions were taken in good faith to try and save the business, this will be relevant in any potential investigation. **V. Key Steps and Recommendations** 1. **Seek Immediate Professional Advice:** Contact an insolvency practitioner (IP) *immediately*. They will assess your situation, explain your options in detail, and advise you on the best course of action. This is absolutely crucial. 2. **Gather Financial Information:** Prepare detailed financial records, including your debts, assets, income, and expenses. This will be essential for any negotiations or formal insolvency procedures. 3. **Prioritize HMRC:** Address the HMRC arrears as a matter of urgency. 4. **Communicate Openly:** Keep your key stakeholders (landlord, suppliers) informed, but be guided by your IP's advice on what to say. 5. **Consider Personal Implications:** Be aware of the potential personal consequences, especially if you've given personal guarantees. 6. **Do not ignore statutory demands.** **Disclaimer:** This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute legal advice. You must seek professional legal and insolvency advice tailored to your specific circumstances. I am an AI Chatbot, and cannot provide legal advice, you need a qualified solicitor.

Q6	I am a real estate developer. Due to the current housing crisis, my mortgages have ballooned, and I am struggling to make money out of the sale of the properties I recently completed. While my housing portfolio is significant, most properties are not yet ready for the market. I am not paying all my suppliers, and the banks are chasing me multiple times per day. If they foreclose, I lose everything. If I complete all my projects, I can repay the banks and the suppliers. However, one of them just filed a petition for winding up my business. I refuse to believe I am insolvent. Is it likely that the petition will be dismissed?	"Okay, let's analyze your situation as a corporate insolvency lawyer in England. This is a complex scenario, and the outcome of the winding-up petition will depend heavily on the specific facts and evidence presented to the court. Here's a breakdown of the key legal issues, potential strategies, and likely outcomes: **1. Understanding the Winding-Up Petition** * **Who Filed It?** You mention ""one of them"" filed the petition. It's crucial to know if this is a *creditor* (e.g., a supplier you haven't paid). Under Insolvency Act 1986, section 124, a creditor can petition for winding-up. * **The Grounds:** The most likely ground for the petition is that your company is ""unable to pay its debts"" under Insolvency Act 1986, section 123. This can be demonstrated in several ways: * **Section 123(1)(a):** If the creditor served a *statutory demand* for a debt exceeding Â£750, and you failed to pay, secure, or compound the debt within three weeks, this creates a presumption of insolvency. This is a very common route. * **Section 123(1)(e):** The creditor can prove you're unable to pay your debts *as they fall due*. This is the ""cash-flow"" test. The fact that you're not paying suppliers and are being chased by banks is strong evidence supporting this. * **Section 123(2):** The creditor can prove that the value of your assets is less than your liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities. This is the ""balance-sheet"" test. Your significant mortgages and unfinished projects are relevant here. **2. Your Argument: ""I Refuse to Believe I Am Insolvent""** Your core argument is that you are *not* insolvent because, if given time, you can complete your projects and repay everyone. This is a crucial point, but it needs to be carefully framed and supported by robust evidence. Here's where the case law becomes very important: * **Cash-Flow vs. Balance-Sheet Insolvency:** You need to address *both* tests. * **Cash-Flow Test (s.123(1)(e)):** You're currently failing this test. *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2)* clarifies that future debts *can* be considered. Simply having potential future income isn't enough. You need to show a clear, *realistic*, and *documented* plan for how you will generate enough cash *in the short term* to meet your immediate obligations. * **Balance-Sheet Test (s.123(2)):** This is where your argument about the value of your portfolio comes in. You need a *professional, independent valuation* of your completed and in-progress properties. This valuation must be realistic and account for the current housing market conditions (the ""housing crisis"" you mentioned). *BNY Corporate Trustee Service Ltd v Eurosail* emphasizes that the balance of probabilities is key, and the burden of proof is on you to show solvency. *Casa Estates* confirms both tests are relevant. * **Hopes and Expectations Are Not Enough:** *Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy* is a critical case. Your belief that you *will* be able to repay if you complete the projects is insufficient. You need *concrete evidence* of funding commitments, firm sales contracts, or other legally binding agreements that demonstrate you have access to the necessary funds. ""Hopes and expectations"" are irrelevant without legally enforceable rights to those assets. * **The ""Point of No Return"" is NOT the Test:** While *BNY Corporate Trustee Service v Eurosail* discredited the ""point of no return"" test, it still requires a robust assessment of your ability to meet liabilities. **3. Potential Strategies and Defenses** Given the seriousness of a winding-up petition, you need to act quickly and decisively. Here are some options: * **Negotiate with the Petitioner:** The best outcome is often to reach an agreement with the creditor who filed the petition. This might involve a payment plan, providing additional security, or securing a short-term loan to pay off the immediate debt. If you can satisfy the petitioner, they may withdraw the petition (Companies House Form DS02 is *not* relevant here, as that's for voluntary striking off). * **Dispute the Debt:** If you genuinely believe the debt is not due or is overstated, you can dispute it. This is a complex area and needs careful legal advice. * **Apply for a Moratorium (Insolvency Act 1986, Section A4):** This is a *very important* option, but it's only available if a winding-up petition has *already* been presented. You, as the directors, can apply to the court for a moratorium. This gives you breathing space from creditor action, including the winding-up petition. * **Key Requirement:** To get a moratorium, you *must* convince the court that it would achieve a *better result for creditors as a whole* than an immediate winding-up (section A4(5)). This is where your detailed plan and property valuations become absolutely critical. You need to demonstrate that a moratorium will allow you to complete the projects, maximize value, and repay creditors more than they would receive in a liquidation. * **Relevant Documents (Section A6):** You'll need to provide significant documentation, including a statement of affairs, a statement from a licensed insolvency practitioner (the ""monitor"") who believes a moratorium is likely to be successful, and other relevant financial information. * **Challenge the Petition:** If you can't negotiate or obtain a moratorium, you'll need to challenge the petition in court. Your defense will focus on proving you are *not* insolvent under s.123, using the evidence discussed above (valuations, financial projections, funding commitments). * **Injunction to Restrain Presentation (unlikely in your case):** *Rushbrooke UK Ltd v 4 Design Concepts Ltd* highlights the importance of proper authority. An injunction to restrain the *presentation* of a petition is rare and usually only granted if there's a clear abuse of process or the debt is genuinely disputed. Since the petition is *already* presented, this is not your situation. * **Administration:** You may discuss with your insolvency practitioner the potential benefits of entering administration. *One Blackfriars Ltd (in liq.), Re* gives guidance on administrators powers. **4. Risks and Considerations** * **Director Disqualification:** If your company is wound up, the liquidator will investigate your conduct as a director. If they find evidence of unfit conduct (e.g., trading while insolvent, failing to keep proper records), you could face disqualification from being a director for up to 15 years under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. * **Wrongful Trading:** If you continue to trade while knowing the company is insolvent and worsen the position of creditors, you could be held personally liable for the company's debts. This is a serious risk. * **Coronavirus defense** *Re A Company [2022] EWHC 943 (Ch)* shows the defence does not work if the business was already doomed to fail. **5. Action Plan** 1. **Immediate Legal Advice:** Do not delay. Consult with a specialist insolvency lawyer immediately. 2. **Gather Evidence:** Compile all financial records, property valuations, contracts, funding commitments, and any other evidence that supports your claim of solvency (or the potential for solvency with a moratorium). 3. **Engage an Insolvency Practitioner:** You'll need an IP to act as the monitor for a moratorium application and to provide expert advice on your financial position. 4. **Negotiate/Moratorium/Defend:** Based on your lawyer's advice, choose the best strategy: negotiate with the petitioner, apply for a moratorium, or prepare to defend the petition in court. 5. **Form WU07:** This form is irrelevant. **Likelihood of Dismissal** Based on your description, it's *unlikely* the petition will be dismissed *without significant action on your part*. You're facing a high burden of proof to demonstrate that you're not insolvent, especially under the cash-flow test. The key to success will be: * **A credible, detailed plan:** Showing how you will generate cash flow to meet immediate liabilities. * **Strong, independent valuations:** Proving the value of your assets. * **Securing funding commitments:** Demonstrating access to the necessary funds, not just hopes. * **Applying for a moratorium:** If you can meet the requirements, this is your best chance of gaining the time you need. This is a very serious situation. Prompt, decisive action with expert legal and financial advice is essential.

Q7	My brother and I have been working together on our hand-made furniture shop for 20+ years. Last year, we had to liquidate the business because we could no longer pay the bills. An official receiver was appointed. Yesterday, he came back to us and asked to repay all the dividends we received in the 5 years before insolvency. This is a ridiculous amount of money (Â£150,000 each). My brother and I never received a salary. The official receiver says that we could not get any dividends because the business was operating at a loss. We were only paid in dividends to avoid income tax, and because my accountant told me that was fine. Surely, we donâ€™t have to repay that money?	"Okay, here's some legal advice regarding your situation, drawing on the relevant legislation and case law you've provided. This is a complex area, and this advice is for general guidance only. You absolutely need to consult with a solicitor who specializes in insolvency law as soon as possible to get tailored advice specific to your full circumstances. **The Core Issue: Unlawful Dividends and Director's Duties** The official receiver's claim centers on the legality of the dividends you and your brother received. The key principle is that dividends can only be lawfully paid out of *distributable profits*. If the company was operating at a loss, there were no distributable profits, and therefore, any dividends paid were unlawful. Your accountant's advice was incorrect, and unfortunately, relying on incorrect professional advice is not generally a defense. Here's a breakdown of the relevant legal points and how they apply to your case: 1. **Directors' Duties (Companies Act 2006):** * **Section 172:** Directors have a duty to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members (shareholders) as a whole. However, when a company is insolvent or nearing insolvency, this duty shifts to consider the interests of the company's creditors. By taking dividends when the company was making a loss, you were likely in breach of this duty, as you were prioritizing your own interests over those of the creditors. * **Section 174:** Directors must exercise reasonable care, skill, and diligence. Relying solely on your accountant's advice without questioning it, especially in a situation where the company was clearly struggling, might be seen as failing to meet this standard. * **Common Law Duties:** Directors also have fiduciary duties to act in good faith in the best interests of the company (similar to s.172) and to avoid conflicts of interest. Taking dividends when the company was insolvent creates a clear conflict. 2. **Unlawful Dividends:** * Dividends must be paid out of distributable profits, as determined by the company's accounts, prepared in accordance with the Companies Act. * If dividends are paid when there are no distributable profits, they are unlawful. * Shareholders who receive unlawful dividends, particularly if they are also directors and knew (or should have known) of the company's financial position, are liable to repay them. This is the core of the official receiver's claim. 3. **The Official Receiver's Role (Insolvency Act 1986):** * **Section 132:** The official receiver has a duty to investigate the causes of the company's failure and the conduct of its directors. This includes investigating transactions that may have been detrimental to creditors. * **Section 399:** Defines the role and appointment of the official receiver. * **The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, section 13.2:** Governs the official receiver's powers in examinations and applications to the court. * **Section 124 and 123** of the Insolvency Act 1986 define the ground for the creditors to petition the court for winding up. 4. **Potential Claims Against You:** * **Misfeasance (Breach of Duty):** The official receiver could bring a claim against you for breach of your directors' duties (under the Companies Act 2006 and common law). This would be based on the argument that you acted improperly by taking dividends when you knew, or should have known, the company was insolvent. * **Transactions at an Undervalue (Insolvency Act 1986):** While less likely in this precise scenario (as dividends are not technically a ""transaction"" in the same way as selling an asset below value), the principle is relevant. The official receiver is essentially arguing that you extracted value from the company (the dividends) when that value should have been available to creditors. * **Preference**: If the dividends can be classified, the payment of dividends to you, could potentially be considered to be putting you in a better position than you would otherwise have been in in the insolvency. If so, they may be unwound. 5. **Defences and Mitigation (Very Limited in Your Case):** * **Good Faith (Limited Applicability):** *Belmont Park Investments* highlights the importance of good faith in complex commercial transactions. However, your situation is different. While you may have *believed* you were acting correctly based on your accountant's advice, this doesn't necessarily equate to ""good faith"" in the legal sense, especially given your 20+ years of experience in the business. You had a responsibility to understand the company's financial position. * **Honest and Reasonable Belief (Section 1157 Companies Act 2006):** This section provides a potential defense for directors who acted honestly and reasonably and ought fairly to be excused. However, it's a high bar to meet, and simply relying on your accountant's advice is unlikely to be sufficient, particularly when the company was visibly struggling. * **Negotiation:** The best approach is likely to be negotiation with the official receiver. You may be able to agree on a reduced repayment amount or a payment plan. This is where a solicitor is crucial. 6. **Why Piercing the Corporate Veil Cases are Less Relevant Here:** * Cases like *Salomon v Salomon*, *Prest v Petrodel*, *MacDonald Dickens & Macklin v Costello*, *Gilford Motor Co v Horne*, *Adams v Cape Industries*, *Gencor ACP Ltd v Dalby*, *FG Films*, and *DHN Food Distributors* primarily deal with situations where the court disregards the separate legal personality of a company to hold shareholders or parent companies liable. Your case is not about piercing the corporate veil. It's about your direct liability *as directors* for breaching your duties. The official receiver is not trying to go after your personal assets because you are shareholders; they are going after you because you were directors who authorized unlawful dividends. 7. **Re Kaytech and Re City Build (London) Ltd:** * These cases are about shadow/de facto directors. You were a de jure director, and were legally appointed. **Steps You Must Take Immediately:** 1. **Seek Legal Advice:** Do not delay in consulting a solicitor specializing in insolvency law. They will review all the documentation, assess the strength of the official receiver's claim, and advise you on the best course of action. 2. **Gather Information:** Collect all relevant documents, including: * Company accounts for the five years in question. * Dividend vouchers or records. * Any correspondence with your accountant regarding the dividends. * Bank statements showing the dividend payments. * Any documentation related to the liquidation and the official receiver's appointment. 3. **Do Not Admit Liability:** While you need to cooperate with the official receiver, do not make any admissions of liability without first speaking to your solicitor. 4. **Consider Negotiation:** Your solicitor will likely advise you to attempt to negotiate with the official receiver. A realistic and achievable repayment plan might be the best outcome. 5. **Accountant's Negligence:** You should also seek legal advice on whether you have a claim against your accountant for professional negligence. If their advice was incorrect and led to this situation, you may be able to recover some of your losses from them. This is a separate legal issue from the official receiver's claim, but it's important to explore. **In summary,** the official receiver's claim is likely to have a strong legal basis. You were directors, and you received dividends that were, in all probability, unlawful. Your reliance on your accountant's advice, while understandable, is unlikely to be a complete defense. Immediate legal advice and a strategy for negotiation are essential.

Q8	My business went into liquidation last year. I was the owner and director. A liquidator was appointed. He is threatening to sue me for breaching my duties as a director unless I return the money I received as monthly repayments for a loan I gave to my company. Heâ€™s also threatening to start a disqualification procedure against me for the same reason. I believe I did nothing wrong â€“ this was a fair loan with interests below the market rate. However, I cannot risk being disqualified, because I am also working as a director in my sisterâ€™s company. What can I do? Should I return the money?	"Okay, here's some advice based on the information you've provided, and drawing on the legal principles and cases you've outlined. It's important to remember this is general advice, and a full assessment would require a detailed review of your company's financial records and the specific circumstances of the loan and repayments. **Key Concerns and Potential Risks** The liquidator's threats are serious and stem from several key areas of insolvency law: 1. **Misfeasance (Insolvency Act 1986, s.212):** This is the core of the liquidator's claim. They're alleging you misused your power as a director by causing the company to repay your loan when it was insolvent (or close to it). The *HLC Environmental Projects* case is directly relevant here. If the liquidator can prove that you knew (or ought to have known) the company was insolvent *at the time of the repayments*, you could be held personally liable to repay that money to the company. 2. **Breach of Director's Duties (Companies Act 2006, s.172):** Directors have a duty to act in the best interests of the company (s.172). Crucially, when a company is insolvent or nearing insolvency, this duty shifts to prioritize the interests of *creditors* (s.172(3)). Repaying your own loan ahead of other creditors could be seen as a clear breach of this duty, as highlighted in *HLC Environmental Projects*. 3. **Director Disqualification (Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986):** If the liquidator believes your conduct as a director makes you unfit to be concerned in the management of a company, they can report this to the Secretary of State, who may initiate disqualification proceedings. A disqualification order would prevent you from being a director of *any* company (including your sister's) for a specified period (2-15 years). This is a very serious consequence. 4. **Preference (Insolvency Act 1986 Sections 239):** It may be possible for the liquidator to prove that your loan repayments were preference payments. A transaction is at risk of being a preference if it occurs within six months of the onset of insolvency, or two years if the transaction is with a connected person. Directors are considered connected persons. **Insolvency Tests: The Liquidator's Perspective** The liquidator will be applying the tests for insolvency outlined in the Insolvency Act 1986, s.123: * **Cash Flow Test (s.123(1)(e)):** Could the company pay its debts as they fell due? This doesn't just mean immediate debts; it includes debts that will become due in the reasonably near future (*Cheyne Finance*). The liquidator will scrutinize the company's cash flow at the time of the loan repayments. * **Balance Sheet Test (s.123(2)):** Were the company's assets less than its liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities? This is a broader test, considering the overall financial position (*BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail*). *Casa Estates* emphasizes that *both* tests are relevant. **Your Defence and Possible Arguments** You need to build a strong defence, and it hinges on demonstrating that you acted honestly and reasonably, and that the company was *not* insolvent (or that you had no reasonable grounds to believe it was insolvent) at the time of the repayments. Here are some key points: * **Good Faith and Honesty:** You must demonstrate that you genuinely believed the company was solvent and could afford the repayments. Documenting your reasoning at the time (e.g., in board minutes, emails) is crucial. * **Fair Loan Terms:** The fact that the loan was at below-market interest rates *is* helpful. It suggests you weren't trying to extract unfair advantage. However, this alone isn't enough. The crucial question is the company's solvency *at the time of the repayments*, not the initial loan terms. * **Financial Records:** You *must* provide the liquidator with complete and accurate financial records (bank statements, management accounts, cash flow forecasts, etc.) for the relevant period. These records will be the primary evidence used to determine solvency. * **Reasonable Belief of Solvency:** Even if the company *was* technically insolvent, you might have a defence if you can show you had a *reasonable* belief, based on available information, that it was solvent. This is a high bar to clear. *Byblos Bank v Al-Khudhairy* highlights that mere ""hopes and expectations"" of future funding aren't sufficient. You need concrete evidence. * **No Preferential Treatment (rebuttal):** Argue that the repayments were made in the ordinary course of business and were not intended to prefer you over other creditors. This is a difficult argument to make when you're repaying a director's loan, but it's worth exploring. **Should You Return the Money?** This is a complex decision with significant consequences: * **Returning the money *might* mitigate the risk of further action.** It could be seen as an admission of liability, however. This is a very important aspect. It could also reduce the likelihood of director disqualification proceedings. * **Returning the money *doesn't guarantee* the liquidator will drop the matter.** They may still pursue disqualification. * **Not returning the money and fighting the claim is risky.** If you lose, you'll likely have to repay the money *plus* the liquidator's legal costs, which could be substantial. You also face the very real risk of disqualification. **Recommended Actions** 1. **Seek Immediate Legal Advice:** Do *not* delay. Engage a specialist insolvency lawyer *immediately*. They will review your situation, advise on the strength of your defence, and represent you in negotiations with the liquidator. This is absolutely critical. 2. **Gather All Documentation:** Collect all relevant documents: * The loan agreement. * Bank statements showing the loan advance and repayments. * Company accounts (management and statutory) for the relevant period. * Board minutes or any other records discussing the loan or the company's financial position. * Cash flow forecasts and any other financial projections. * Any correspondence with the liquidator. * Any correspondence with other creditors. 3. **Cooperate with the Liquidator (with legal advice):** While you need to protect your position, being obstructive will likely worsen the situation. Your lawyer will advise on how to cooperate appropriately without prejudicing your case. 4. **Consider Negotiation:** Your lawyer can negotiate with the liquidator. A settlement might be possible, potentially involving a partial repayment or an agreement to avoid disqualification proceedings in exchange for cooperation. 5. **Understand the Liquidator's powers:** The liquidator is appointed to act in the best interest of all creditors, pursuant to the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986, including the power to take action for misfeasance against you as director. **Important Considerations** * **Statutory Demand:** Be aware that a creditor (or the liquidator) could issue a statutory demand for payment of a debt. Failure to comply with a statutory demand can lead to a winding-up petition (if issued against a company) or bankruptcy proceedings (if issued against an individual). * **The ""point of no return"" test, while discredited in *BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail*, is still a useful concept.** The courts will look at the overall picture of the company's financial health. * **The burden of proof is on the liquidator** to prove insolvency and misfeasance, as established in BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail. **In summary, the situation is serious, but not necessarily hopeless. Your priority is to get expert legal advice immediately and build a robust defence based on evidence of your good faith and the company's financial position at the relevant time.** Do not try to handle this alone. The consequences of getting it wrong are too severe.

Q9	My business is operating at a loss. Chase Bank is my major lender, and they have a security over my home. I fell into arrears towards several suppliers, but I do believe I can turn around my business if I am given a bit more time to repay my debts. What can I do?	"Okay, let's break down your situation and explore the potential options. It's crucial to act swiftly and strategically in these circumstances. Here's a structured approach, drawing on the legal principles and resources you've provided: **1. Assessment of Your Financial Position: Insolvency Tests** The first step is to honestly and accurately assess whether your company is currently insolvent. There are two primary tests, and *both* must be considered, as established in *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383*: * **Cash Flow Test (s.123(1)(e) Insolvency Act 1986):** Can your company pay its debts as they fall due? This doesn't just mean debts currently due, but also those falling due in the reasonably near future. *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)* clarified that this includes consideration of *prospective* debts. The fact that you are in arrears with suppliers suggests a cash flow problem. * **Balance Sheet Test (s.123(2) Insolvency Act 1986):** Are your company's assets less than its liabilities, taking into account *contingent and prospective liabilities*? This requires a thorough valuation of your assets and a realistic assessment of all liabilities, including potential future ones. *BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28* emphasized the balance of probabilities standard for this test, with the burden of proof on the party asserting insolvency. The existence of Chase Bank's security on your home *does not* automatically render you bankrupt, the debt can be treated as two debts, one secured, and the other unsecured, because of IA 1986 s 269. **Important Considerations:** * **""Reasonably Near Future"":** The law doesn't define a precise timeframe, but courts generally look at the immediate future. Your belief that you can turn the business around is relevant, but it needs to be supported by concrete evidence and a realistic plan, not just ""hopes and expectations"" (*Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986)*). * **Contingent and Prospective Liabilities:** These are liabilities that may arise in the future depending on certain events. You need to factor these in. **2. Potential Actions by Creditors (Suppliers and Chase Bank)** * **Suppliers:** * **Statutory Demands:** Suppliers owed more than Â£750 can serve a statutory demand (Insolvency Act 1986, s.123(1)(a)). This is a formal written demand requiring payment within 21 days. Failure to comply creates a presumption of insolvency, which can be used as grounds for a winding-up petition. * **Winding-Up Petition:** If a supplier has grounds (e.g., an unsatisfied statutory demand or other evidence of inability to pay debts), they can present a winding-up petition to the court (Insolvency Act 1986, s.124). This is a serious step that could lead to the company being liquidated. * **County Court Judgments (CCJs):** Suppliers could sue for the debt and obtain a CCJ. If this remains unpaid, they can use enforcement methods (e.g., bailiffs). * **Chase Bank:** * **Enforcement of Security:** As Chase Bank has security over your home, they have several options if you default on your loan agreement. They could appoint a receiver to take control of and sell the secured property. The specific terms of your loan agreement are crucial here. * **Demand for Repayment:** Chase Bank may demand full repayment of the loan. **3. Your Potential Options and Strategies** Given your belief in the business's viability and your desire for more time, here are some key options: * **Negotiation and Communication:** * **With Suppliers:** Immediately contact your suppliers. Explain your situation, propose a realistic repayment plan, and be transparent about your efforts to turn the business around. Many creditors are willing to negotiate if they see a genuine prospect of eventual payment. * **With Chase Bank:** Proactively communicate with Chase Bank. Explain the situation, your turnaround plan, and how you intend to address the arrears. Explore options like a temporary payment holiday, interest-only payments, or a revised repayment schedule. * **Formal Insolvency Procedures (if negotiation fails or is insufficient):** * **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** This is a formal agreement with your creditors to repay a portion of your debts over a set period (typically 3-5 years). It requires the approval of 75% (by value) of your creditors who vote. A CVA binds all creditors, even those who voted against it (subject to certain conditions). This is a good option if the underlying business is viable but needs restructuring. * **Administration:** This involves appointing an administrator (an insolvency practitioner) to take control of the company. The administrator has a primary duty to rescue the company as a going concern. If that's not possible, they will aim to achieve a better result for creditors than would be likely in a winding-up. Administration provides a moratorium (breathing space) from creditor action, including winding-up petitions. This is a more drastic step, but it can be effective in protecting the business while a longer-term solution is found. * **Moratorium** The moratorium gives struggling businesses formal breathing space in which to explore rescue and restructuring options, free from creditor action. * **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** If the business is truly not viable, a CVL may be the most appropriate option. This involves the company's directors resolving to wind up the company and appointing a liquidator. The liquidator's role is to realize the company's assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors. While this means the end of the company, it can be a more controlled process than a compulsory winding-up. You could use Companies House Form DS01 to strike the company off the register. * **Informal Arrangements:** Continue trying to reach informal agreements with creditors outside of formal insolvency procedures. * **Restoration** If your company has already been struck off the register, you could apply to restore it using Companies House form RT01. **4. Director's Duties and Potential Risks** As a director, you have crucial duties, particularly when the company is facing financial difficulty: * **Duty to Promote the Success of the Company (s.172 Companies Act 2006):** This duty shifts when the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency. You must prioritize the interests of creditors over shareholders (*BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016]*). * **Wrongful Trading (s.214 Insolvency Act 1986):** If you continue to trade while knowing (or when you ought to have known) that there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation, you could be held personally liable for the company's debts incurred during that period. *Re Pure Zanzibar Ltd [2022]* illustrates the consequences of reckless conduct. * **Transactions at an Undervalue (s.238 Insolvency Act 1986):** If you dispose of company assets for significantly less than their value, this could be challenged by a liquidator. * **Preferences (s.239 Insolvency Act 1986):** If you favor one creditor over others (e.g., paying one supplier in full while others remain unpaid), this could be challenged. * **Director Disqualification:** The Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 contains provisions for disqualifying directors in case of unfit conduct. **5. Key Steps to Take Immediately** 1. **Seek Professional Advice:** *This is absolutely essential.* Consult with a qualified insolvency practitioner (IP) and a solicitor specializing in insolvency law. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific circumstances. 2. **Gather Financial Information:** Prepare detailed, up-to-date financial statements, including a cash flow forecast, balance sheet, and list of creditors. 3. **Develop a Turnaround Plan:** Create a realistic and detailed plan showing how you intend to improve the business's financial position. This should include specific actions, timelines, and projected financial outcomes. 4. **Communicate with Creditors:** As discussed above, open communication is crucial. 5. **Document Everything:** Keep meticulous records of all communications, decisions, and actions taken. This will be important if your conduct as a director is later scrutinized. **Disclaimer:** *This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute legal advice.

Q10	My business went into liquidation last March. I tried my best to avoid it. I may have preferred some creditors over others, but simply because they knew I was struggling, and they would not give me their products on credit. I may also have taken some money out of the business account to repay the mortgage on my house. Surely, I did nothing wrong? Do I risk anything?	"Okay, let's break down your situation and the potential risks you face. It's important to remember that I'm providing general legal advice based on the information you've given, and a full assessment would require a detailed review of all the facts and figures. However, I can highlight the key areas of concern and relevant legal principles. **Key Issues and Potential Risks** Based on your description, the following issues raise potential legal concerns: 1. **Preferential Payments:** You state you ""may have preferred some creditors over others."" This is a major red flag in insolvency. The law aims to ensure fair treatment of all creditors, and intentionally paying some creditors ahead of others in the period leading up to liquidation can be considered a ""preference."" 2. **Transactions at an Undervalue / Misappropriation of Company Funds:** You mention taking money from the business account to repay your personal mortgage. This is another very serious issue. Company funds are for the business, not for the personal benefit of directors, especially when the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency. This could be considered a transaction at an undervalue, or even misfeasance/breach of fiduciary duty. 3. **Wrongful Trading / Fradulent Trading** It is important to work out, when the business became insolvent, i.e. unable to pay their debts as they fell due. If it happened before last March, there is a possibility that trading was wrongful or fradulent. **Relevant Law and Explanation** Here's a breakdown of the relevant legal principles and how they apply to your situation: * **1. Preferences (Insolvency Act 1986, Section 239):** * **Definition:** A preference is a transaction where a company, within a specific ""relevant time"" before liquidation (usually 6 months, or 2 years if the preference is to a ""connected person"" â€“ which you, as a director, are), does something that puts a creditor in a better position than they would have been in the liquidation. * **Your Situation:** Paying suppliers who demanded payment because they knew you were struggling *could* be a preference. The key is whether you *intended* to put them in a better position. It's not simply about paying them; it's about the *reason* for paying them. If you were simply trying to keep the business running by securing essential supplies, and you genuinely believed the business could recover, this might be a defense. However, if the dominant intention was to improve the position of those specific creditors at the expense of others, it's likely a preference. * **Consequences:** The liquidator can apply to the court to have the preference reversed. The creditors who received the preferential payments would have to repay the money to the company, to be distributed fairly among all creditors. * **Case Law:** While *Belmont Park Investments* deals with the anti-deprivation principle, it highlights the importance of good faith and commercial sense. If your actions were genuinely driven by a (realistic) attempt to save the business, this *might* be a mitigating factor, but it's not a guaranteed defense against a preference claim. * **2. Transactions at an Undervalue (Insolvency Act 1986, Section 238):** * **Definition:** A transaction at an undervalue is where a company, within the relevant time (usually 2 years before liquidation), enters into a transaction for no consideration or for consideration that is significantly less than the value of what the company provided. * **Your Situation:** Using company funds to pay your personal mortgage is almost certainly a transaction at an undervalue. The company received no benefit in return for the payment. This is a very serious issue. * **Consequences:** The liquidator can apply to the court to have the transaction set aside. You would likely be required to repay the money to the company. * **Case Law:** *Casa Estates* highlights the importance of assessing both cash flow and balance sheet insolvency. Even if you *thought* the business might recover (cash flow), the fact you were using company funds for personal expenses suggests a serious underlying financial problem (balance sheet). * **3. Misfeasance / Breach of Fiduciary Duty (Insolvency Act 1986, Section 212; Companies Act 2006, Section 172):** * **Definition:** Directors have fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of the company, and when the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency, those duties shift to primarily consider the interests of the creditors. Misfeasance is a breach of these duties. * **Your Situation:** Taking money for your mortgage is a clear breach of your duty to act in the best interests of the company and its creditors. It's a misuse of company assets. * **Case Law:** *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA* is relevant here. It clarifies that the duty to consider creditors' interests doesn't arise simply because there's a long-term liability on the balance sheet. However, it *does* arise when the company is insolvent or bordering on insolvency. Your actions, particularly taking money for personal use, strongly suggest you were in that zone. * **Consequences:** The liquidator can pursue you personally for compensation for the losses caused to the company by your breach of duty. * **4. Wrongful Trading (Insolvency Act 1986, Section 214):** * **Definition:** If a director knew, or ought to have concluded, that there was no reasonable prospect of the company avoiding insolvent liquidation, and they continued to trade, they can be held liable for wrongful trading. * **Your Situation:** This depends on *when* you knew (or should have known) the company was doomed. If you continued to trade and incur debts when you knew (or should have known) there was no hope of recovery, you could be liable. The fact that you were taking money out for your mortgage suggests you might have been aware of the severity of the situation. * **Consequences:** You could be ordered to contribute personally to the company's assets to compensate for the losses caused by your wrongful trading. * **5. Fradulent Trading (Insolvency Act 1986, Section 213):** * **Definition:** Carrying on the business with intent to defraud creditors. * **Your Situation:** This depends on whether you acted dishonestly. * **Consequences:** You could be ordered to contribute personally to the company's assets to compensate for the losses caused by your wrongful trading. You might also face criminal charges. * **6. Director Disqualification (Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986):** * **Consequences:** If your conduct as a director is found to be unfit, you could be disqualified from acting as a director for a period of 2 to 15 years. This is a separate process from the liquidator's actions to recover assets, but the same facts (preferences, transactions at an undervalue, misfeasance, wrongful trading) can lead to both. * **7. Notion of Insolvency (Insolvency Act 1986, Section 123):** * **Definition:** The Act provides two main tests for insolvency: * **Cash Flow Test (s.123(1)(e)):** Unable to pay debts as they fall due. *Cheyne Finance (No 2)* confirms this includes considering future debts. * **Balance Sheet Test (s.123(2)):** Liabilities exceed assets, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities. *BNY Corporate Trustee Service v Eurosail* emphasizes the balance of probabilities standard for this test. *Byblos Bank* shows that mere hopes of future funding aren't enough. * **Your Situation:** Your actions (preferring creditors, needing to use company funds for personal expenses) strongly suggest you were likely insolvent under *both* tests. **Key Steps and Advice** 1. **Full Disclosure:** You *must* be completely honest and transparent with the liquidator. Withholding information will only make things worse. 2. **Cooperate:** Cooperate fully with the liquidator's investigation. Provide all requested documents and information promptly. 3. **Seek Immediate Legal Advice:** You need to speak to an experienced insolvency lawyer *immediately*. This is a complex area of law, and the consequences can be severe. A lawyer can assess your specific situation, advise you on your rights and obligations, and represent you in any proceedings. 4. **Be Prepared for Potential Claims:** Understand that you are likely to face claims from the liquidator to recover the preferential payments and the money you used for your mortgage. 5. **Consider a Statement of Affairs (LIQ02):** Although not strictly applicable in a compulsory liquidation (which it sounds like you have, given the timeline), understanding the format of a Statement of Affairs is helpful. It forces you to think about the company's assets and liabilities in a structured way, which is essential for your lawyer to assess your position. 6. **Companies House Forms:** You don't say whether a liquidator resigned. If so, LIQ06 would apply. LIQ02 is only relevant to voluntary liquidations. **In summary, your situation is serious. You face potential personal liability for preferential payments, transactions at an undervalue, misfeasance, and potentially wrongful trading. You also risk director disqualification. Seeking immediate, expert legal advice is absolutely crucial.** "	52.01689839363098	2	Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 188 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 247 (Interpretation for First Group of Parts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Marches Credit Union Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 1731 (Ch) (Liquidation; Locus standi; Petitions; Union)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Companies House Form LIQ02: Use this form to give notice of a statement of affairs.|Companies House Form LIQ06: Use this form to give notice of a liquidator's resignation in members' voluntary liquidation or creditors' voluntary liquidation.|Companies House Form AM22: Use this form to give notice of a move from administration to creditors' voluntary liquidation.
Q11	My life-long partner just left me for an Italian scugnizzo who is 15 years younger than her. Whatâ€™s worse is that before leaving, she emptied our joint business account and she stopped paying the joint mortgage we have on our business. The bank is threatening legal actions against me, and to foreclose on the business property. What can I do? By the way, I cannot contact my (ex) partner but I believe sheâ€™s now in Italy with her new partner.	"Okay, I understand this is a very difficult and distressing situation. Let's break down the legal issues and potential options, focusing on the business and financial aspects. I will assume that the ""joint business account"" and ""joint mortgage"" relate to a business operated through a limited company, of which you and your ex-partner were directors and shareholders. If it's a partnership (not a limited company), the legal framework is slightly different, but many of the principles will still apply. **Immediate Concerns and Actions:** 1. **The Bank and the Mortgage:** This is the most pressing issue. The bank's threat of legal action and foreclosure is serious. You need to communicate with the bank *immediately*. Explain the situation (your partner's actions, your inability to contact her, and your commitment to finding a solution). Do *not* ignore their communications. This buys you time and shows good faith. Explore these options with the bank: * **Negotiate a repayment plan:** Can you make partial payments, or can the bank offer a temporary payment holiday or interest-only period? * **Explore refinancing:** Is it possible to secure a new loan, perhaps on different terms, to pay off the existing mortgage? * Find alternative methods to fund the repayments, including temporary loans. 2. **Your Ex-Partner's Actions:** Her actions are potentially illegal and severely detrimental to your interests. Consider these points: * **Emptying the Joint Business Account:** This is a major issue. As directors of a company, both you and your ex-partner have fiduciary duties. She has likely breached these duties. Specifically, she likely breached her duty to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company (similar to the issues in *BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA*). She may also have committed a transaction at an undervalue, if the funds were used for personal benefit rather than for the company's legitimate purposes. This relates to principles explored in *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re* and *Barclays Bank Plc v Eustice*. * If the ""joint business account"" was a partnership account the ex-partner is liable for the missing funds. * If the funds have been used to benefit a third party, you may have a case to make the third party accountable for the debts (*Insolvency Act 1986* section 251R). * **Stopping Mortgage Payments:** As a joint mortgagor, she remains jointly and severally liable for the mortgage debt, even if she has left. However, her failure to contribute makes your situation much harder. 3. **Gathering Information:** Start collecting all relevant documents: * Company documents (Memorandum and Articles of Association, shareholder agreements, director service agreements). * Bank statements for the business account. * Mortgage documents. * Any communication with your ex-partner (emails, texts, etc.). * Any evidence of her whereabouts or new relationship (if relevant to tracing assets). **Legal Options and Analysis:** 1. **Director Disqualification and Misconduct Claims:** * **Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986:** You could potentially report your ex-partner's conduct to the Insolvency Service. If they investigate and find her unfit to be a director, she could be disqualified from acting as a director for a period of time. This doesn't directly recover the money, but it is a punitive measure and may be relevant if the company becomes insolvent. * **Breach of Fiduciary Duty:** You (or the company, if it's still solvent) can sue your ex-partner for breach of fiduciary duty. This would be a claim to recover the money she took from the account and any losses caused by her actions (e.g., costs associated with the bank's legal action). This is a civil claim, and you'd need to prove her breach and the resulting loss. * **Transaction at an Undervalue:** If the company becomes insolvent, a liquidator could pursue a claim against your ex-partner under the Insolvency Act 1986 to recover the funds she took. This is a ""transaction at an undervalue"" if she took the money for less than its worth (i.e., for no consideration from the company's perspective). 2. **Insolvency Considerations:** * **Winding Up Petition (Insolvency Act 1986, s.124 & s.123):** If the company cannot pay its debts as they fall due (cash flow test) or if its liabilities exceed its assets (balance sheet test), it is insolvent. *Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re* and *Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re* are key cases here. *BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail* clarifies the balance sheet test, requiring you to consider contingent and prospective liabilities on the balance of probabilities. The bank, as a creditor, could petition to wind up the company. You, as a director, could also petition, but this is a serious step with significant consequences. * **Voluntary Liquidation:** If the company is insolvent, you, as a director, could consider placing it into voluntary liquidation. This is a more controlled process than a compulsory winding-up by the court. * **Administration:** If there's a chance of rescuing the business, administration might be an option. An administrator would take control of the company and try to find a way to save it or achieve a better outcome for creditors than liquidation. * **Insolvency and hoping for future funds:** Case law such as *Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy* confirms, hope for future funds is not sufficient. 3. **Tracing and Recovering Assets:** * **Freezing Orders:** If you can show a good arguable case that your ex-partner has assets (e.g., property, bank accounts) and there's a real risk she'll dissipate them, you could apply for a freezing order (formerly known as a Mareva injunction) to prevent her from disposing of those assets. This is a powerful tool but requires strong evidence. * **Cross-Border Issues:** Because your ex-partner is likely in Italy, recovering assets will be more complex. If you obtain a judgment against her in England, you'd need to enforce it in Italy. This involves international legal procedures. The principles in *Re Entertainment Ltd* regarding cross-border insolvency might be relevant if she has assets in multiple jurisdictions. * Since Italy is an EU member, the process for enforcing the judgment in Italy is more straightforward. 4. **Personal liability:** * As the mortgage is joint, you remain liable for the full outstanding amount. **Steps to Take Now:** 1. **Engage a Solicitor:** This is absolutely crucial. You need a solicitor specializing in insolvency and commercial litigation *immediately*. They will advise you on the best course of action based on your specific circumstances. 2. **Contact the Bank:** As mentioned above, open communication is key. 3. **Gather Evidence:** Start collecting all relevant documents. 4. **Do not attempt to dissolve the company without legal advice.** Filling out a DS01 form in this circumstance would be highly inappropriate and could lead to further legal problems. You are a director, and you have a responsibility. **Important Disclaimer:** This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute legal advice. Your situation is complex, and you must seek professional legal advice tailored to your specific circumstances from a qualified solicitor. The above is an analysis of your possible legal positions and options, not a guarantee of any particular outcome. Good luck.

Q12	After Brexit, I set up a business in the Netherlands. This is a limited liability company. I am the sole director of that company. There are no employees in the Netherlands, just some people I hire occasionally to load and unload the lorries that distribute my products to the rest of Europe. I have now decided to stop selling goods to Europe, because it is not profitable. I want to wind-up the business here in the UK. Can I do it?	"Okay, here's a breakdown of your situation and the legal advice, framed from the perspective of a UK corporate insolvency lawyer: **Understanding Your Situation** You have a limited liability company registered in the *Netherlands*, not in the UK. You are the sole director of that Dutch company. You are considering winding up *a* business in the UK, but the key is whether this constitutes a separate legal entity, or is simply an aspect of your Dutch company's activities. **Crucial Clarification Needed: The UK ""Business""** The most important question is: **What legal form does your UK ""business"" take?** There are several possibilities, each with drastically different consequences for winding up: 1. **No Formal UK Entity:** If your UK activities were *solely* conducted through your Dutch company (e.g., you simply shipped goods from the Netherlands to the UK, using the Dutch company's bank accounts, invoices, etc.), then there is no separate UK company to wind up. You would wind up the *Dutch* company under *Dutch* law. My advice as a *UK* lawyer is limited in this scenario, as I am not qualified to advise on Dutch insolvency law. 2. **UK Branch/Establishment:** If you registered your Dutch company as having a ""UK establishment"" with Companies House (this is a requirement if you have a place of business or branch in the UK), then this creates a UK presence, but *not* a separate legal entity. The UK establishment is still part of the Dutch company. Winding up would still primarily be a matter of *Dutch* law, but there would be UK implications (see below). You should check the nature of the UK prescence. 3. **UK Subsidiary Company:** If you set up a *separate* UK company (limited by shares, for example) that is owned by your Dutch company, then this is a distinct legal entity. This is the scenario where UK insolvency law becomes fully relevant. 4. **Sole Trader/Partnership**: This is much less likely given the structure. It is only the company in the Netherlands that is a limited liability company. **Assuming a UK Branch/Establishment (Scenario 2 - Most Likely)** This is a common scenario for businesses expanding internationally. Here's how it works: * **Primary Insolvency Proceedings:** The main insolvency proceedings would take place in the Netherlands, under Dutch law. You'd need to consult a Dutch insolvency lawyer. * **UK Implications:** * **Notification to Companies House:** You would need to notify Companies House that the Dutch company (and therefore its UK establishment) is being wound up. There are specific forms for this. * **UK Creditors:** UK-based creditors (e.g., suppliers, landlords, HMRC for any UK taxes) would likely participate in the Dutch insolvency proceedings, but they *might* have the option to pursue assets located in the UK. The interplay of UK and Dutch insolvency law in cross-border situations is complex. * **Assets in the UK:** Any assets of the Dutch company located in the UK (e.g., inventory, bank accounts) would form part of the Dutch company's estate for the purposes of the winding-up. The Dutch liquidator (or equivalent) would have control over these assets. * **Potential for Secondary Proceedings:** In very rare circumstances, if there are significant UK assets and creditors, and the Dutch process is not adequately protecting their interests, a UK court *could* open secondary insolvency proceedings in the UK. This is uncommon. * **Director Duties**: Your actions as a director are judged under the rules of incorporation. **Assuming a UK Subsidiary Company (Scenario 3)** If you have a separate UK limited company, here's the process: * **UK Insolvency Law Applies:** The winding-up would be governed entirely by UK law, specifically the Insolvency Act 1986, the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, and related legislation. * **Winding-Up Options:** * **Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL):** If the UK company is *solvent* (can pay all its debts), you, as the shareholder (through the Dutch company), can initiate an MVL. This is a relatively straightforward process, but requires a declaration of solvency. * **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** If the UK company is *insolvent* (cannot pay its debts), you, as the director, should initiate a CVL. This involves appointing a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP) who will take control of the company, realize assets, and distribute funds to creditors. * **Compulsory Liquidation:** If you don't take action and the company is insolvent, a creditor (including HMRC) could petition the court for a compulsory liquidation. This is less desirable as it removes your control over the process. * **Director's Duties:** As a director of the UK company, you have duties under the Companies Act 2006 and common law. If the company is insolvent, your duties shift primarily to protecting the interests of creditors. Failure to do so could lead to personal liability (e.g., wrongful trading, misfeasance â€“ see *McTear v Eade*). * **Limited Liability:** Generally, as a director of a limited company, your personal liability is limited. However, this protection can be lost in cases of misconduct (e.g., fraud, wrongful trading). *Prest v Petrodel* highlights the circumstances, albeit rare, where the corporate veil can be pierced. * **Liens**: A creditor cannot usually try to use a lien on company property *Bristol Airport Plc v Powdrill*. **Key Steps and Advice (Assuming Either Scenario 2 or 3)** 1. **Determine the Legal Form of your UK ""Business"":** This is the *absolute first step*. Check your paperwork, Companies House records, and any legal advice you received when setting up your operations. 2. **Obtain UK and Dutch Legal Advice:** If you have a UK establishment (Scenario 2), you *must* consult a Dutch insolvency lawyer. You should also consult with a UK lawyer (like myself) to understand the UK implications. If you have a UK subsidiary (Scenario 3), UK insolvency law is paramount. 3. **Assess Solvency:** If you have a UK subsidiary, determine whether it is solvent or insolvent. This dictates the winding-up options. 4. **Act Promptly (Especially if Insolvent):** If there's any possibility of insolvency in either the Dutch or a UK company, take action quickly. Delay can worsen the situation and increase the risk of personal liability for directors. 5. **Consider Professional Help:** Appointing a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP) is usually essential in a CVL and can be very helpful in an MVL to ensure all legal requirements are met. 6. No relevant Companies House forms are included above. **Disclaimer:** This is general legal information, not formal legal advice. Your specific circumstances require a detailed review. I strongly recommend you contact me or another qualified UK insolvency lawyer, and a Dutch lawyer if applicable, to discuss your situation in detail.
