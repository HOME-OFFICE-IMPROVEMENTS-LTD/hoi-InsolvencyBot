Q1	I have been the director of three companies over the last few years: Motor Racing Limited, Car Racing Limited, and Classic Racing Limited. The first two have gone into liquidation six months ago. Am I allowed to continue trading with the third company?	As covered by The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 22.5, a director could be prohibited from acting as a director of another company, or take part in its management, if that other company is known by a name which is either the same as a name used by the company in insolvent liquidation in the 12 months before it entered liquidation or is so similar as to suggest an association with that company. In your case, Classic Racing Limited should not be seen as having a name that is so similar to Motor Racing Limited or Car Racing Limited as to suggest an association, unless there has been some branding or trading style that ties them all together in such a way as to suggest a link to the general public. Under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986, you should also consider if your behaviour as a director of the first two companies does not make you unfit to be involved in the management of a company. This could result in your disqualification as a director for a period of up to 15 years. The official receiver will examine your conduct and may apply to the court for a disqualification order. Finally, you must ensure compliance with Insolvency Act 1986 section 188. This stipulates that every invoice, order for goods or business letter issued by or on behalf of the company in liquidation clearly states that it is being wound up. Failing to comply may result in fines. I recommend that alongside this advice, you should seek consultation from an attorney who can provide more specific guidance based on the complete circumstances of your situation.	26.805293798446655	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 247|The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 22.5|Insolvency Act 1986 section 188	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383|Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd, Re [1988] Ch. 477|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form LIQ09|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM22|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form MT03
