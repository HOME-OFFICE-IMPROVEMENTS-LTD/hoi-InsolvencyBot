Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	I'm not a lawyer, but I can provide some general guidance. It's essential to seek professional advice from a solicitor or a business lawyer as soon as possible. It appears that there may be a dispute over the validity of the stock transfer form and the removal of your directorship. The fact that you signed the form and were told it would be filed and that you would be removed as a director suggests that you had a reasonable expectation of being released from your responsibilities. However, it seems that the other director is claiming that you are still a director and responsible for winding down the business, selling assets, and paying off debts. This is a serious situation, and you need to take immediate action to protect yourself. Here are some steps you can consider taking: 1. **Seek legal advice**: Consult with a solicitor or business lawyer who can review the stock transfer form, the company's articles of association, and any other relevant documents. They can advise you on your rights and obligations as a director and help you understand the implications of the situation. 2. **Verify the company's records**: Request a copy of the company's register of directors and shareholders to confirm whether you are still listed as a director. You can also ask for a copy of the company's articles of association and any other relevant documents. 3. **Respond to the other director**: Write a formal letter to the other director, stating that you are seeking legal advice and that you do not accept the responsibility of winding down the business, selling assets, and paying off debts. You can also request clarification on the status of your directorship and the company's records. 4. **Return the keys**: As you mentioned, return the keys to the offices via recorded delivery, and keep a record of the delivery. This will help establish that you have not taken possession of the keys or any company assets. 5. **Do not take any action**: Until you receive legal advice, do not take any action that could be seen as accepting responsibility for the company's affairs. Avoid making any decisions or taking any steps that could be interpreted as acknowledging your role as a director. Remember, this is a complex situation, and it's essential to seek professional advice to protect your interests. A solicitor or business lawyer can help you navigate this situation and ensure that your rights are protected.	206.85750317573547	1	"[[""Does the lawyer mention the key features of a director?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to sections 154-155 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer identify the criteria for being a director under the law?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to sections 250-251 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to the circumstances in which a director can be removed from their position?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to s.168 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law when advice is provided?"", ""Does the lawyer ask which form was signed?

Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	I'm so sorry to hear about the situation you and your family are facing. It's unacceptable that your partner hasn't been paid his wages, and it's even more concerning that the subcontractor, X, is ignoring his calls and texts. I'll do my best to provide you with some guidance and potential steps you can take. **Immediate Action** 1. **Contact the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB)**: Although they have a 14-day turnaround, it's essential to get their advice on record. You can also try calling them to see if they can provide any interim guidance or support. 2. **Contact the local authority**: Reach out to your local council or authority to see if they can provide any emergency financial assistance or support. **Pursuing X, Y, and the massive UK house builder** 1. **X (the subcontractor)**: You can try sending a formal letter to X, stating the amount owed, the dates of work, and the fact that your partner hasn't been paid. This letter should be polite but firm, and you can CC Y and the massive UK house builder. You can also consider sending a follow-up email or letter if you don't receive a response. 2. **Y (the main contractor)**: As Y has stated that they won't pay X due to non-completion of work, you may want to contact Y to explain your partner's situation and ask if they can provide any assistance or guidance. Be prepared to provide evidence of your partner's work and the amount owed. 3. **The massive UK house builder**: While it's unlikely that they will take direct responsibility for your partner's wages, you can try contacting their customer service or complaints department to report the issue. They may not care, but it's worth a try. You can explain the situation and ask if they have any procedures in place to ensure that their subcontractors are paying their workers. **Other Options** 1. **ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service)**: ACAS is a free service that can help resolve employment disputes. You can contact them to see if they can assist with your partner's situation. 2. **Employment Tribunal**: If your partner hasn't been paid his wages, he may be able to claim for unpaid wages through an Employment Tribunal. However, this process can be lengthy and may require professional representation. 3. **Small Claims Court**: If the amount owed is below £10,000, your partner may be able to take X to the Small Claims Court to recover the debt. **Additional Tips** 1. **Keep a record**: Document all correspondence, including emails, letters, and phone calls, with X, Y, and the massive UK house builder. 2. **Seek support**: Reach out to friends, family, or local support groups for emotional support during this challenging time. 3. **Explore local resources**: Look into local resources, such as food banks, credit unions, or debt counseling services, to help manage your finances. Remember to stay calm and persistent in your pursuit of the owed wages. It's essential to keep a record of all correspondence and to seek professional advice when necessary. Please keep me updated on any progress you make, and I'll do my best to provide further guidance and support.	211.3609893321991	1	"[[""Does the lawyer ask if all companies involved are limited liability companies?"", ""Does the lawyer ask which kind of contract the petitioner had with X?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the requirements for lifting the corporate veil?"", ""Does the lawyer outline what the options are if X enters into a formal insolvency procedure (particularly administration and liquidation)?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that employee wages have a preferential treatment in insolvency?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to ss.166-184 ERA 1996 and Schedule 6 IA 1986?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that occupational or personal pension schemes are protected under the law, and that the employee can claim unpaid contributions to the Secretary of State?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to ss.124-126 Pension Schemes Act 1993?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to relevant case law?"", ""Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3]]"	3.0	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	I can sense the gravity of your situation and the emotional toll it's taking on you. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed and uncertain about the future. Firstly, please know that you haven't lost everything yet. You've come to the right place seeking help and advice, and that's a crucial step in navigating this challenging situation. To address your concerns, I'll try to break down the key points and offer some general guidance. However, please note that I'm not a lawyer, and it's essential to consult a specialist lawyer who can provide personalized advice tailored to your specific circumstances. 1. **Cross-guarantee and RLS loan:** It's clear that Company B is liable for the RLS loan due to the cross-guarantee. This means that the bank can pursue Company B for the loan amount in case of Company A's liquidation. 2. **Intercompany loan:** The insolvency practitioner will likely request repayment of the intercompany loan, which Company B may struggle to pay, especially considering the additional liabilities. 3. **Pressure from liquidators:** The liquidators' suggestion to put Company B into administration might seem like a convenient solution for them, but it's essential to explore alternative options that could help you retain control and minimize losses. Considering your situation, here are some potential avenues to explore: 1. **Negotiate with the liquidators:** You may want to engage a lawyer to negotiate with the liquidators and explore possible alternatives to administration, such as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) or a scheme of arrangement. This could help you retain control of Company B and avoid administration. 2. **Refinance or restructure debt:** Depending on Company B's financial situation, you might be able to refinance or restructure the debt to make it more manageable. This could involve negotiating with the bank or exploring alternative lenders. 3. **Seek protection for Company B:** If Company B is facing significant pressure from creditors, you may want to consider seeking protection through a moratorium or a temporary stay of proceedings. This could give you breathing room to explore options and negotiate with creditors. 4. **Explore asset protection:** Depending on the circumstances, you might be able to protect certain assets, such as the industrial unit, through a trust or other legal structures. It's essential to consult a specialist lawyer who can assess your situation and provide personalized advice. They can help you navigate the complexities and explore options that might not be immediately apparent. Regarding your question about whether it's worth carrying on, I'd say that it's definitely worth exploring all available options before making any decisions. You've invested 17 years of hard work into your business, and it's understandable that you want to protect it. Take a deep breath, and let's take things one step at a time. You've already taken the first step by seeking help and advice. Now, it's time to work with a specialist lawyer to develop a strategy that can help you navigate this challenging situation. Keep in mind that you're not alone, and there are professionals who can help you find a way forward. Don't give up yet; there might be a solution that can help you retain control of your business and minimize losses. How do you feel about seeking a specialist lawyer's advice? Is there anything specific you'd like to know or any particular concerns you'd like to address?	7.515232086181641	1	"[[""Does the lawyer refer to the relevant statutes (ss. 123-124 IA 1986) to determine if a company (like Company B) is insolvent?"", ""Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"In the UK, the general principle is that a company's assets and a director's personal assets are separate. However, there are some exceptions and nuances to consider when it comes to personal debts and company assets. If an individual has a personal debt, creditors can attempt to recover the debt from the individual's personal assets. However, they cannot directly seize company assets to pay a personal debt, unless: 1. **Security**: If the individual has provided a personal guarantee or security for a company loan or debt, the creditor may be able to pursue the individual's personal assets, including company assets, to recover the debt. 2. **Fraud or Misconduct**: If the individual has committed fraud or misconduct, such as misusing company funds for personal gain, a court may ""pierce the corporate veil"" and allow creditors to pursue company assets to recover personal debts. 3. **Beneficial Ownership**: If the company is considered a ""sham"" or a mere ""alter ego"" of the individual, a court may disregard the company's separate identity and allow creditors to pursue company assets to recover personal debts. 4. **Insolvency**: If the individual is declared bankrupt or enters into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), their personal assets, including any interests in company assets, may be subject to the insolvency process. In general, creditors cannot directly seize company assets to pay a personal debt, unless one of the above exceptions applies. However, creditors may try to: 1. **Freeze assets**: Obtain a court order to freeze the individual's personal assets, including company assets, to prevent them from being dissipated or hidden. 2. **Third-party debt orders**: Obtain a court order requiring the company to pay the individual's debt, if the company owes the individual money. 3. **Charging orders**: Obtain a court order to place a charge on the individual's interest in company assets, which can be enforced if the debt is not paid. To minimize the risk of company assets being seized to pay a personal debt, it's essential for the individual to: 1. **Maintain a clear separation**: Ensure that personal and company finances are kept separate and distinct. 2. **Avoid personal guarantees**: Refrain from providing personal guarantees for company debts, unless absolutely necessary. 3. **Keep accurate records**: Maintain accurate and transparent financial records for both personal and company affairs. 4. **Seek professional advice**: Consult with a solicitor or accountant to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations. In summary, while company assets are generally protected from personal debts, there are exceptions and nuances to consider. It's crucial for individuals to maintain a clear separation between personal and company finances and seek professional advice to minimize the risk of company assets being seized to pay a personal debt."	210.79743576049805	1	"[[""Does the lawyer ask which type of bankruptcy procedure has been opened against the director (if any)?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the requirements to be appointed as a director under English law?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to ss.250-251 IA 1986?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the principle of separate legal personality?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the exceptions to the principle of separate legal personality?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that directors owe fiduciary duties to the company?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to ss.171-177 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that piercing the corporate veil may occur as a result of the director breaching their fiduciary duties towards the company?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to relevant case law?"", ""Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]]"	9.0	[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	No|No|No|Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	What a stressful situation! Firstly, take a deep breath and try not to worry too much. You've already taken steps to dissolve the company, and it's likely that Utility Bidder is trying to scare you into paying. Here are some points to consider: 1. **Debt collection agency tactics**: They're trying to intimidate you into paying by suggesting you can't dissolve the company due to the outstanding debt. However, this is not necessarily true. The debt collection agency is just trying to do their job, but they may not be aware of the specifics of your situation. 2. **Contractual obligations**: You did sign a contract with Utility Bidder, but you've stopped trading and the company is being dissolved. It's likely that the contract is no longer enforceable, as the company is ceasing to exist. 3. **Dissolving the company**: You've already applied to Companies House to dissolve the company, and this process should continue. The debt collection agency can't stop this process, but they may try to persuade you to settle the debt to avoid any further action. 4. **Insolvency practitioner**: You don't need to spend £2k+ on an insolvency practitioner. This is likely a scare tactic to make you think you need professional help. You can handle this situation yourself, and it's unlikely that an insolvency practitioner would be necessary. 5. **Payment plan**: If you're not willing or able to pay the debt, you can politely decline the payment plan offer. You've already explained that the company has no money, and it's not your personal responsibility to pay the debt. 6. **Your assets**: As you've mentioned, most of the equipment was yours personally, and you used company money for ingredients and small items. This suggests that there are no significant company assets that could be used to pay the debt. Considering these points, you can: * Stick to your guns and let the debt collection agency continue to try to contact you. They may eventually give up or realize that the debt is not recoverable. * Politely decline any further communication or offers from the debt collection agency. You've already explained your situation, and there's no need to engage further. * Continue with the dissolution process, and let Companies House handle the formalities. * If you receive any further correspondence or threats, you can respond by reiterating your position and stating that you're not willing or able to pay the debt. Remember, you've done nothing wrong, and you're simply trying to close down a company that's no longer trading. Stay calm, and don't let the debt collection agency bully you into paying a debt that you can't afford.	209.76665878295896	1	"[[""Does the lawyer ask how the company was dissolved?"", ""Does the lawyer ask for the forms submitted for dissolving a company?"", ""Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	I'll provide general guidance on this matter, but please note that the specific procedures and laws may vary depending on your jurisdiction. It's essential to consult with a qualified insolvency lawyer or expert in your local laws to ensure you follow the correct process. In general, creditor committees are formed to represent the interests of creditors in an insolvency or restructuring process. If you believe the existing committee is not acting in the best interest of the creditors, you may be able to take action to modify the committee's composition. **Removing existing members and replacing them with others:** 1. **Check the governing documents**: Review the terms of reference, constitution, or bylaws of the creditor committee to see if they provide a mechanism for removing members. These documents may outline the process for removal, including any required notice periods, voting requirements, or grounds for removal. 2. **Insolvency laws and regulations**: Familiarize yourself with the relevant insolvency laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. These laws may provide a framework for removing committee members, such as requiring a resolution passed by a certain percentage of creditors or a court order. 3. **Creditor resolution**: If the governing documents or insolvency laws allow, you may be able to propose a resolution to remove existing members and replace them with new ones. This resolution would typically need to be voted on by the creditors, and the required majority may vary depending on the jurisdiction. 4. **Court application**: If the above options are not available or successful, you may need to apply to the court to remove the existing members and appoint new ones. This would typically require demonstrating that the existing committee is not acting in the best interest of the creditors and that the proposed new members would better represent the creditors' interests. **Adding new members:** 1. **Governing documents**: Again, review the terms of reference, constitution, or bylaws of the creditor committee to see if they provide a mechanism for adding new members. 2. **Insolvency laws and regulations**: Check if the relevant insolvency laws and regulations in your jurisdiction allow for the addition of new members to the committee. 3. **Creditor resolution**: You may be able to propose a resolution to add new members to the committee, which would need to be voted on by the creditors. 4. **Court application**: If the above options are not available or successful, you may need to apply to the court to add new members to the committee. **Key considerations:** * Ensure that any proposed changes to the committee's composition are made in accordance with the governing documents, insolvency laws, and regulations. * Provide adequate notice to all creditors and stakeholders of any proposed changes. * Be prepared to demonstrate that the proposed changes are in the best interest of the creditors. * Consider seeking the advice of a qualified insolvency lawyer or expert to guide you through the process. Remember that the specific procedures and laws may vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it's essential to consult with a qualified expert to ensure you follow the correct process.	570.9081389904022	2	"[[""Does the lawyer ask what kind of formal insolvency procedure has the company been admitted to?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the duties of the members of the creditors\u2019 committee?

Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	Based on the information provided, it appears that the company is solvent, meaning it has sufficient assets to pay off its debts, except for the telecoms contract. In this scenario, you may not necessarily need to appoint a liquidator. Since the company is solvent, you could consider a Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL). An MVL is a process where the company is wound up voluntarily by its members (shareholders) when it is no longer needed or viable. This process is typically used when a company is solvent and has no debts, or when the debts can be paid off. However, in your case, the telecoms contract with 7 years remaining could be considered a debt. If the company is unable to pay the remaining contract value, it may be considered insolvent. You have a few options to consider: 1. **Negotiate with the telecoms provider**: Although you mentioned they are being unreasonable, it's worth trying to negotiate again. You could offer to pay a lump sum to terminate the contract early or propose a compromise. 2. **Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL)**: If the telecoms provider is unwilling to negotiate, you could consider an MVL. In this scenario, the liquidator would take control of the company's assets and liabilities, including the telecoms contract. The liquidator would then try to negotiate with the telecoms provider or seek to terminate the contract. 3. **Strike off the company**: If the telecoms contract is the only outstanding issue, you could consider striking off the company. This involves applying to Companies House to have the company removed from the register. However, this option is only available if the company has no debts or liabilities, or if the debts can be paid off. In your case, the telecoms contract would need to be addressed before striking off the company. It's recommended that you consult with a professional, such as an accountant or insolvency practitioner, to discuss your options in more detail and determine the best course of action for your specific situation. In terms of the costs, an MVL can be more expensive than striking off the company, as it involves appointing a liquidator and paying their fees. However, an MVL can provide more flexibility and control over the winding-up process. Ultimately, the decision to appoint a liquidator will depend on the specific circumstances of your company and the advice of a professional.	469.84785079956055	2	"[[""Does the lawyer say the company should not usually require liquidators purely for the reason of being unable to terminate the telecoms contract?"", ""Does the lawyer say that potentially, the company may face an insolvent liquidation if the telecom company refuses to compromise or if the contract is not assigned to a third party?

Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	It appears that you have missed the deadline for exercising the break clause in your lease agreement by 7 days. The lease agreement requires a minimum of 3 months' notice to be given to the landlord, and you have only provided 2 months and 3 weeks' notice. In this situation, the landlord is likely to argue that you have failed to comply with the terms of the lease agreement, and therefore, the break clause cannot be exercised. This means that you may be liable for the remaining 2 years of the lease. However, there are a few potential arguments that you could make to try to mitigate the situation: 1. **Waiver**: You could argue that the landlord has waived the requirement for 3 months' notice by arranging viewings for prospective tenants and discussing the possibility of an early termination with you. This could be seen as an indication that the landlord was willing to accept a shorter notice period. 2. **Estoppel**: You could argue that the landlord's actions (arranging viewings and discussing an early termination) have led you to believe that the break clause could be exercised with a shorter notice period. This could be seen as an estoppel, which is a legal principle that prevents a party from denying or asserting something that is contrary to what they have previously stated or done. 3. **Negotiation**: You could try to negotiate with the landlord to see if they are willing to accept a shorter notice period or to agree to an early termination of the lease. This could involve offering to pay a penalty or to provide additional notice. It's worth noting that the landlord's position may be influenced by their ability to find a new tenant. If they are able to find a new tenant quickly, they may be more willing to negotiate an early termination of the lease. In any case, it's recommended that you seek the advice of a solicitor who specializes in commercial property law to help you navigate this situation and to advise you on the best course of action.	4.472468614578247	1		0.0		0	
Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	I can sense the frustration and uncertainty you're feeling about the future of your business. It's completely understandable, given the challenges you've faced, especially during the pandemic. I'll try to provide some guidance and options to consider. **Current Situation:** * You have a LTD company with a good trading history, but the business is no longer viable due to various reasons. * You have a BBL (Bounce Back Loan) with Natwest, which you've been paying consistently until January, when you took a payment holiday. * You have an overdraft (OD) with the bank, which has a directors' guarantee, but you think you can cover this with asset sales. * You have outstanding invoices from the retail store closure, which won't be covered by asset sales. * You have two lease cars with 1 year left on the lease, but no directors' guarantee. * Your customer base has declined, and cash flow is a daily struggle. **Options to Consider:** 1. **Liquidation:** This involves winding up the company and selling its assets to pay off creditors. You can either do this voluntarily (Members' Voluntary Liquidation) or compulsorily (Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation). Your accountant can help you with this process. 2. **Administration:** This is a formal insolvency process that allows the company to continue trading while a licensed insolvency practitioner (IP) takes control. The IP will try to rescue the business or sell its assets to pay off creditors. 3. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** This is a formal agreement between the company and its creditors to pay off debts over time. However, this option might not be suitable if you have a significant amount of debt or if creditors are unlikely to agree to the proposal. 4. **Selling the Business:** If you think there's still value in the business, you could try to sell it. However, this might be challenging, given the current market conditions and the decline in your customer base. 5. **Dissolution:** This involves closing the company and removing it from the Companies House register. However, this option is only suitable if the company has no assets, liabilities, or outstanding debts. **Next Steps:** 1. **Meet with your accountant:** Discuss your options with your accountant and get their professional advice on the best course of action. 2. **Gather information:** Make sure you have all the necessary documents and information, including financial statements, debt schedules, and asset valuations. 3. **Contact creditors:** Inform your creditors about your situation and discuss possible options, such as payment holidays or debt restructuring. 4. **Consider seeking professional advice:** If you're unsure about the best option or need guidance on the process, consider seeking advice from a licensed insolvency practitioner or a business advisor. **Additional Tips:** * Be prepared for a potentially lengthy and complex process. * Keep your creditors informed and up-to-date on your situation. * Consider seeking support from a business advisor or mentor to help you navigate the process. * Take care of your mental health and well-being during this challenging time. Remember, it's essential to seek professional advice to ensure you're making the best decision for your business and personal circumstances. Your accountant and other advisors can help you navigate the process and find the most suitable solution.	107.45133256912231	1	"[[""Does the lawyer mention the key liquidation options available to the company (i.e. members\u2019 voluntary liquidation and creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation)?"", ""Does the lawyer mention the key restructuring options available to the company (i.e. administration and company voluntary arrangements)?"", ""Does the lawyer mention other important restructuring options (i.e. pre-packaged administration, schemes of arrangement and restructuring plans)?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to the relevant sections of the law (Insolvency Act 1986 and Companies Act 2006) to describe the liquidation and restructuring options available to the company?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that directors owe fiduciary duties to the company (ss.171-177 CA 2006)?"", ""Does the lawyer refers to the consequences associated with misfeasance (s.212 IA 1986) and wrongful trading (s.214 IA 1986)?"", ""Does the lawyer outline the directors\u2019 duties when the company is insolvent?"", ""Does the lawyer warn that some transactions made soon before insolvency could be challenged as being unlawful (ss.238-239, 244-245, 423 IA 1986)?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to relevant case law?"", ""Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3]]"	9.0	[3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	Yes|Yes|No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	I'm glad you've finally reached out for help. Your situation sounds incredibly stressful, and it's understandable that you're worried about the potential consequences of bankruptcy. Firstly, I want to acknowledge that it's not your fault that your previous accountants failed to manage your company's finances properly. However, now that the issue has been identified, it's essential to take proactive steps to address the situation. Given the complexity of your situation, I would strongly recommend seeking independent advice from a qualified professional, such as an insolvency practitioner or a specialist in tax and insolvency law. They can provide you with personalized guidance and help you explore all available options. Here are a few potential steps you could consider: 1. **Seek a second opinion**: Before proceeding with bankruptcy, it's essential to get a second opinion from another insolvency practitioner or a specialist in tax and insolvency law. They may be able to identify alternative solutions or provide a more nuanced understanding of your situation. 2. **Explore Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: A CVA is a formal agreement between your company and its creditors to pay off debts over time. This might be a viable option if your company has a viable business model and can generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations. 3. **Consider a Time to Pay (TTP) arrangement**: If you're struggling to pay your tax liabilities, you may be able to negotiate a TTP arrangement with HMRC. This allows you to pay your tax debts in installments over a set period. 4. **Look into Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)**: An IVA is a formal agreement between you and your creditors to pay off debts over time. This might be a more suitable option if you're facing personal bankruptcy. 5. **Review your company's financials**: Work with your new accountants to review your company's financials and identify areas where costs can be reduced or optimized. This may help improve your company's cash flow and reduce the likelihood of bankruptcy. To find independent advice, you can: 1. **Contact the Insolvency Practitioners Association (IPA)**: The IPA is a professional body that regulates insolvency practitioners in the UK. They can provide you with a list of qualified practitioners in your area. 2. **Reach out to a specialist law firm**: Look for law firms that specialize in tax and insolvency law. They can provide you with expert advice and representation. 3. **Contact a business rescue specialist**: Companies like Begbies Traynor, KPMG, or PwC offer business rescue services, including insolvency advice and support. Remember, it's essential to act quickly and seek professional advice to minimize the risk of bankruptcy and protect your future prospects. Please keep in mind that I'm not a qualified professional, and my advice should not be considered as a substitute for personalized guidance from a qualified expert.	5.134634494781494	1	"[[""Does the lawyer mention the key liquidation options available to the company (i.e. members\u2019 voluntary liquidation and creditors\u2019 voluntary liquidation)?"", ""Does the lawyer mention the key bankruptcy options (e.g. bankruptcy, IVA, restructuring plan) available to the company director?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to the relevant sections of the law (Insolvency Act 1986 and Companies Act 2006) to describe the liquidation and restructuring options available to the company?"", ""Does the lawyer mention the potential civil liability of the previous accountants for failing to act according to a professional standard?"", ""Does the lawyer mention that directors owe fiduciary duties to the company (ss.171-177 CA 2006)?

Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	"You're thinking of the concept of ""service provision change"" under TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006). In addition to the traditional business transfer scenario, TUPE also applies to service provision changes, which include: 1. A client engaging a new contractor to provide services (outsourcing) 2. A contractor reassigning a contract to another contractor (re-tendering) 3. A client bringing a contracted-out service back in-house (insourcing) However, the scenario you described, where a new butcher takes over the same premises, is not necessarily a service provision change. To determine whether TUPE applies, you need to consider the following factors: * Is the new butcher providing the same services as the previous butcher (i.e., selling meat products)? * Is the new butcher taking over the same premises, including equipment and facilities? * Is the new butcher using the same or similar staff to provide the services? If the answer to these questions is yes, it's possible that TUPE might apply. However, the key factor is whether there is an ""economic entity"" that is being transferred. In this case, the economic entity is the business of selling meat products from the same premises. To determine whether TUPE applies, you would need to consider whether the new butcher is: * Taking over the same customer base * Using the same or similar equipment and facilities * Providing the same or similar services * Retaining the same or similar staff If the new butcher is essentially taking over the same business, including the premises, equipment, and staff, then TUPE might apply. However, if the new butcher is starting from scratch, with new equipment, staff, and a different business model, it's less likely that TUPE would apply. In the scenario you described, it's possible that TUPE might apply, but it would depend on the specific circumstances of the takeover. The new butcher would need to consider whether they are taking over an economic entity that is being transferred, and whether they are required to take on the employees of the previous butcher. It's worth noting that the employees of the previous butcher may be entitled to consultation and potentially protection under TUPE, even if the new butcher is not required to take them on. The new butcher would need to consult with the employees and their representatives to determine the best course of action."	5.880298376083374	1		0.0		0	
Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	"I'm so sorry to hear about the struggles you're facing with your business. It's completely understandable to feel heartbroken, especially after investing so much time and effort into building your company since 2012. Regarding your question about striking off the company, I'll try to provide some guidance. Since you've already spoken with HSBC and they've indicated that they won't liquidate the company, it's likely that the company will be left in a state of dormancy until Companies House takes action. Companies House has a process called ""striking off"" or ""dissolution,"" which is used to remove a company from the register when it's no longer trading or has ceased to exist. However, this process typically requires the company to meet certain conditions, such as: 1. The company must not have traded or carried on business for at least 3 months. 2. The company must not have any outstanding debts or liabilities, apart from those that are considered ""insignificant"" (e.g., less than £100). 3. The company must not be subject to any ongoing legal proceedings or investigations. In your case, since you have a Bounce Back Loan (BBL) with HSBC, it's unlikely that Companies House will strike off the company until the loan is dealt with. The BBL is a government-backed loan, and the lender (HSBC) may need to follow specific procedures to recover the debt. It's possible that HSBC may choose to write off the loan or accept a reduced payment, but this would depend on their internal policies and the specific circumstances of your case. You may want to ask HSBC about their plans for the BBL and how it will affect the company's status. In the meantime, you may want to consider the following options: 1. Voluntary strike-off: You could apply to Companies House to strike off the company voluntarily, but this would require you to meet the conditions mentioned above and obtain the necessary consents from creditors (in this case, HSBC). 2. Members' voluntary liquidation (MVL): Although HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate the company, you could consider an MVL, which is a process where the company's assets are distributed to its members (shareholders) after paying off creditors. However, this would require the company to have sufficient assets to cover the costs of the process. 3. Waiting for Companies House to strike off: As you mentioned, Companies House may eventually strike off the company if it's deemed to be dormant or inactive. However, this could take several years, and it's unclear how the BBL would be affected during this time. It's essential to seek professional advice from an accountant or insolvency practitioner to discuss your specific situation and explore the best course of action. They can help you navigate the process and ensure that you comply with all relevant regulations. Regarding your personal feelings, it's completely normal to feel hurt and emotional about the situation. Losing a business can be a significant loss, and it's okay to acknowledge those feelings. You may want to consider seeking support from a business mentor, counselor, or a support group to help you cope with the emotional aspects of closing your business. I hope this information helps, and I wish you the best in navigating this challenging situation."	371.2494287490845	2	"[[""Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	I can understand your concerns and frustrations with the situation. Given the circumstances, it's reasonable that you want to end the partnership and continue the business alone. Here are some technicalities and potential pitfalls to consider: 1. **Expulsion and Dissolution**: As a two-partner partnership, expelling your partner would likely result in the instant dissolution of the partnership. This is because a partnership is a contractual agreement between two or more parties, and the removal of one partner would render the agreement unenforceable. However, this can be mitigated by including a clause in the partnership agreement that allows for the continuation of the business in the event of a partner's expulsion or departure. 2. **Partnership Agreement**: Review your partnership agreement to understand the terms and conditions of expulsion, dissolution, and the distribution of assets. The agreement may outline the process for resolving disputes, valuing the business, and dividing assets. 3. **Goodwill and Intellectual Property**: Goodwill refers to the intangible assets of a business, such as its reputation, customer base, and brand recognition. In a partnership, goodwill is typically considered a shared asset. However, if your partnership agreement includes a clause that prohibits your partner from setting up a similar business or claiming entitlement to goodwill, this could limit their ability to claim a share of the goodwill. Regarding intellectual property, such as the business name, logo, or trademarks, these are typically considered assets of the partnership. If you want to continue using the business name and intellectual property, you may need to negotiate with your partner to transfer ownership or obtain a license to use these assets. 4. **Valuation and Distribution of Assets**: When dissolving a partnership, the assets are typically valued and distributed according to the partnership agreement or the Partnership Act 1890. You may need to engage a valuer or accountant to determine the value of the business and its assets. 5. **Buying Out Your Partner**: If you want to continue the business alone, you may need to buy out your partner's share of the assets. This could involve negotiating a purchase price based on the valuation of the business and its assets. 6. **Potential Pitfalls**: Be aware of the following potential pitfalls: * Your partner may dispute the valuation of the business or the distribution of assets. * Your partner may claim entitlement to goodwill or intellectual property. * Your partner may attempt to set up a competing business, potentially breaching the non-compete clause in the partnership agreement. * You may need to negotiate with your partner to resolve any outstanding issues, such as unpaid debts or liabilities. 7. **Reassurance**: It's essential to seek professional advice from a solicitor or accountant who specializes in partnership law and business dissolution. They can guide you through the process, help you navigate potential pitfalls, and ensure that your interests are protected. In terms of next steps, consider the following: 1. **Seek Professional Advice**: Engage a solicitor or accountant to review your partnership agreement and provide guidance on the dissolution process. 2. **Valuation and Asset Distribution**: Engage a valuer or accountant to determine the value of the business and its assets. 3. **Negotiate with Your Partner**: Attempt to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement for the distribution of assets and the buyout of your partner's share. 4. **Prepare for Dispute Resolution**: Be prepared to resolve any disputes that may arise during the dissolution process. Remember to prioritize your own interests and seek professional advice to ensure a smooth transition.	6.040012836456299	1	"[[""Does the lawyer encourage the petitioner to look at the partnership agreement?

Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	I'm not a certified financial advisor, so please take my response as general guidance only. You should consider consulting a qualified accountant or insolvency expert for personalized advice. In the UK, when winding up a limited company, the general rule is to prioritize creditors in a specific order. This is outlined in the Insolvency Act 1986: 1. **Secured creditors**: These are creditors with a security interest in specific assets, such as a mortgage or a charge over a property. In your case, this doesn't seem to apply. 2. **Preferential creditors**: These are creditors who have a preferential claim, such as employees (not applicable in your case) or HMRC (if you owe taxes, which you haven't mentioned). 3. **Unsecured creditors**: This is the category your energy, water, and broadband suppliers fall into, as well as your directors' loans. Given your situation, here's a suggested approach: 1. **Energy supplier**: As you have a significant quarterly payment due this month, consider paying this first, as it's a larger amount and may be more pressing. 2. **Water and broadband suppliers**: You can then allocate funds to these suppliers, as they are also unsecured creditors. 3. **Directors' loans**: While you should not prioritize these over other creditors, you may want to consider paying yourself back some or all of the £2,000, as this is a legitimate debt owed to you and your wife. After allocating funds to these creditors, if there's still a shortfall, the suppliers may send you a reminder or a final demand. If you're unable to pay, they may: * Send the debt to a collections agency * Take you to court to recover the debt * Report the debt to credit reference agencies, which could affect your personal credit score However, since your company is being wound up, the creditors may not pursue you personally for the debts, as they would need to prove that you, as a director, were responsible for the debt (e.g., through wrongful trading or misfeasance). To minimize potential issues, consider: * Informing your suppliers about the company's wind-up and your intention to pay as much as possible from the remaining funds. * Keeping records of all payments, communications, and correspondence with creditors. * Ensuring you follow the correct procedures for winding up your company, including filing the necessary documents with Companies House and HMRC. Again, please consult a qualified accountant or insolvency expert to ensure you're following the correct procedures and meeting your obligations as a director.	7.576996564865112	1	"[[""Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?
