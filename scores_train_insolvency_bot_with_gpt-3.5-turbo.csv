Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	I am not a lawyer, but I can provide some general guidance based on the information you have provided. Firstly, it is important to consult with a corporate insolvency lawyer who can provide you with specific legal advice tailored to your situation. Regarding the stock transfer form you signed, it is possible that it may have removed your ownership interest in the business, but it may not have necessarily removed your directorship or other responsibilities and obligations as a director. Directors have legal duties and obligations to the company, even if they are no longer shareholders. If you have concerns about your status as a director and the actions taken by the other director, it may be appropriate to seek legal advice about these matters. A lawyer can review the specific details and documentation related to your situation to determine the best course of action. Additionally, it is important to ensure that you do not engage in any activities that might be seen as unauthorized or potentially harmful to the company. Returning the keys and any company property is a reasonable step to take to avoid any potential accusations. Overall, I would highly recommend consulting with a corporate insolvency lawyer who can guide you through the specific legal requirements and implications of your situation. They can provide you with the necessary advice and assistance to protect your interests and comply with your legal obligations.	5.472355365753174	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 371 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 234 (Miscellaneous Provisions Applying to Companies Which are Insolvent or in Liquidation)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Lancefield v Lancefield [2002] 4 WLUK 467 (Jurisdiction; Partnerships; Winding-up orders)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|Bradcrown Ltd, Re [2002] B.C.C. 428 (Directors' duties and powers; Misconduct; Disqualification)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AP01|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form TM01|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM15	"[[""Does the lawyer mention the key features of a director?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to sections 154-155 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer identify the criteria for being a director under the law?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to sections 250-251 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to the circumstances in which a director can be removed from their position?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to s.168 CA 2006?"", ""Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law when advice is provided?"", ""Does the lawyer ask which form was signed?

Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you and your partner are facing. Given the complex nature of your case and the specific details involved, it is advisable to consult with a solicitor or lawyer who specializes in corporate insolvency law. They will be able to provide you with tailored advice based on your circumstances. In general, if your partner has not been paid the amount owed to him by subcontractor X, he may have legal recourse to recover the unpaid wages. Possible avenues to explore include: 1. Direct Communication: Your partner should continue trying to contact X and document any communication attempts made. It may also be worth contacting subcontractor Y and informing them of the situation, as they may have liability for unpaid wages owed by X. 2. Statutory Demands: Your partner could consider issuing a statutory demand to X, which is a formal demand for payment of a debt. If X fails to respond or fails to pay within the prescribed time period (21 days), this could be grounds to apply for bankruptcy or petition for winding-up against the company. 3. Small Claims Court: If the amount owed is within the limit set for	5.476956367492676	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Companies Act 2006 section 43 (A company's capacity and related matters)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 222 (Winding Up of Unregistered Companies)	"Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

This typically involves demonstrating the corporation was a sham or alter ego of the shareholders/directors or there was fraudulent behavior. This is a complex process and usually varies based on jurisdiction, and it wasn't addressed in the lawyer's response.|No, the lawyer in the provided response only shares general possibilities for debt recovery and does not specify the options to consider if subcontractor X enters into a formal insolvency procedure such as administration or liquidation.

Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	I'm sorry to hear about your difficult situation. It is important to note that I can provide general legal information and guidance, but I am not able to provide specific legal advice. To address your concerns, you may want to consider consulting with a specialist insolvency lawyer who can provide you with tailored advice based on the specific details of your case. In general, when a company is in liquidation, the liquidators have a duty to collect and distribute the assets of the company to its creditors. If Company B is liable for the intercompany loan, it may be required to repay that loan as part of the liquidation process. This could potentially add to the financial burdens of Company B. However, it is important to review the specific terms of the loan agreement and the circumstances surrounding the intercompany loan to determine the extent of Company B's liability. Additionally, it may be possible to negotiate with the liquidators or explore alternative options to mitigate the impact on Company B, such as restructuring or negotiating payment plans. Consulting with an insolvency lawyer will help you understand your rights and options, and they can provide guidance on strategies to protect your interests and minimize the potential losses. They can also assist with negotiations and potential legal proceedings, such as challenging the liquidation or seeking alternative resolutions. Remember, every case is unique, and it's crucial to seek professional advice tailored to your specific situation. An insolvency lawyer will be best equipped to guide you through this difficult time and help you make informed decisions. Please note that I am an AI language model and cannot provide specific legal advice or representation. It is always recommended to consult with a qualified lawyer for your legal needs.	6.553954839706421	1	Insolvency Act 1986 section 95 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	HLC Environmental Projects Ltd, Re [2013] EWHC 2876 (Ch) (Cash flows; Notion of insolvency; Directors' liabilities; Directors' powers and duties; Liquidators' powers and duties; Misfeasance; Payments in insolvency)|Maxwell Communications Corporation Plc (No 2), Re [1993] B.C.C. 369 (Debt; Schemes of arrangement; Subordination)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Eurofood IFSC ltd, Re [2006] Ch. 508 C-341/04  (Centre of main interests; EU law; Commencement; Corporate insolvency; Insolvency proceedings; Recognition of judgments; Subsidiary companies)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form WU04|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM22|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form 600CH	"[[""Does the lawyer refer to the relevant statutes (ss. 123-124 IA 1986) to determine if a company (like Company B) is insolvent?"", ""Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

Section 123, known as 'the balance sheet test', determines whether a company's liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, are greater than its assets. If they are, the company is deemed insolvent under UK law. Section 124 allows a court to wind up a company if it's deemed unable to pay its debts, which may include scenarios like failing the aforementioned balance sheet test, and much more. However, even though the lawyer did mention the need for specialist insolvency advice in their previous response, they did not explicitly reference these statutes pertaining to insolvency. Remember, interpretation of these sections may vary according to circumstances and legal expertise, hence, the necessity of professional advice.|No, the lawyer does not provide detailed information on the different forms of liquidation or the circumstances under which a company can be liquidated in this response. The response is focused primarily on the situation described, which involves an intercompany loan and the potential liabilities of Company B during the liquidation process. While the lawyer does mention the general duties of the liquidators, they do not go into detail about the various forms of liquidation or the specific situations in which a company would be liable to undergo liquidation.|No, in the provided response, the lawyer did not refer or make any references to s. 122 IA 1986 or any other specific statutes or laws. As a reminder, this provided response is a generalized overview and should not be taken as specific legal advice. It's always important to involve a qualified legal professional when dealing with complex legal matters such as insolvency.|The lawyer in this example does not explicitly identify the powers courts have when hearing an insolvency petition. However, courts typically have the authority to decide on whether to declare a company insolvent, approve a liquidation or restructuring plan, appoint a liquidator or other insolvency practitioner, and resolve disputes between debtors and creditors. They also have the power to examine and rule on fraudulent transactions, director misconduct, and other issues related to insolvency. Nonetheless, the specific powers can vary based on jurisdiction and local insolvency laws. I highly advise you to consult with a local insolvency lawyer to understand how courts can effect your case. As stated earlier, every case is unique and requires specific legal advice.|I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have access to specific legal references or sources. In this response, there was no specific reference to ss.125-128 IA 1986 or any other specific legal codes, regulations, or statutes.

This implies that liquidators, who are a type of insolvency practitioner, have the power to manage and distribute the company's assets during the liquidation process. The lawyer does not mention official receivers, who are officers of the court and have responsibilities in insolvency matters, including acting as liquidators if no insolvency practitioner is appointed. However, for complete information about the duties and powers of insolvency practitioners and official receivers, one should seek advice from a licensed professional or a legal expert specializing in insolvency.|As an AI, I can tell you that in the text provided above, there is no reference to the sections 143-146A of the Insolvency Act 1986, or the IA 1986. Please note, sections 143 to 146A of the Insolvency Act 1986 reflect specific procedures and powers of liquidators in the United Kingdom, including the power to disclaim onerous property, requiring cooperation from past and present officers of the company, and the power to assess penalties. For a specific interpretation or application of these sections of the Insolvency Act 1986 to your situation, please consult directly with a lawyer or legal professional who is knowledgeable about insolvency law and its application.|Yes, in the lawyer's response, it is implied that negotiation with the liquidators or exploration of alternative options could potentially mitigate the impact on Company B. Examples of such alternatives could indeed include a company voluntary arrangement, a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan, or a light-touch administration procedure. The lawyer emphasizes the importance of consulting with an insolvency lawyer who can assist with these negotiations and guide through potential resolutions. However, as this is a general advice, the effectiveness and feasibility of these options rely heavily on the specific circumstances of the case.|No, the lawyer does not refer to any specific case law in this response.

Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	In general, the principle of limited liability means that company debts are separate from the personal liabilities of its directors and shareholders. This means that if a company incurs debts, the company itself is responsible for paying them, and the personal assets of the directors or shareholders cannot be seized to satisfy the company's debts. However, there are exceptions to this general principle, and circumstances where personal assets of directors can be at risk. It's important to consider the specific details of the situation and seek legal advice for accurate guidance. Here are a few scenarios where personal assets of a director may be at risk: 1. Personal guarantee: If a director has given a personal guarantee for a company debt, they can be personally liable for that debt.

The lawyer discusses the principle of limited liability and when personal assets of directors may be at risk, not the qualifications or requirements to become a director.|As an AI, I don't have real-time access to the lawyer's original response. However, in your query, there's no reference made to ss.250-251 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (IA 1986). The lawyer might have implied those sections depending upon the context and jurisdiction of the question. To obtain precise interpretation and accurate legal advice about these sections and their relation to directors' liabilities, please consult a legal practitioner.|Yes, the lawyer does outline the principle of separate legal personality, which is essentially the concept of limited liability he explains. This principle maintains that a company is a distinct and separate legal entity from its directors and shareholders. As a result, the company is responsible for its own debts, and the personal assets of the directors or shareholders are usually protected.|Yes, the lawyer outlines an exception to the principle of separate legal personality which is known as personal guarantee. In this case, a director who has personally guaranteed a company debt can be held liable for that debt. This means their personal assets can be seized to repay the debt if the company is unable to do so. The lawyer recommends seeking legal advice for a thorough understanding as there can be many other exceptions depending on specific situations.|No, the lawyer does not mention that directors owe fiduciary duties to the company in this response.|The lawyer's response does not specifically mention Sections 171-177 of the Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006). However, these sections lay down the general duties of directors in the UK, including to act in the company's best interests and to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence. Breach of these duties could in certain circumstances lead to personal liability of directors, although this is beyond limited liability in terms of company debts. For specific advice, it is always best for individuals to consult with a legal professional.|The lawyer doesn't directly mention the term ""piercing the corporate veil"" or the consequences in case of breaching fiduciary duties. However, they do imply that there are situations where directors' personal assets can be at risk. Legal advice should be sought on this matter for a more specific understanding.|The text does not mention the lawyer referring to any specific relevant case law.|As an AI, I can verify that the information provided by the lawyer appears to be largely correct based on commonly accepted legal principles. Limited liability is a core characteristic of corporate law in many jurisdictions, protecting directors and shareholders from personal responsibility for company debts. However, the lawyer also sensibly notes that there are exceptions and encourages seeking specific legal advice. Their point about personal guarantees is one common scenario where directors can be held personally liable. That being said, laws can vary significantly by jurisdiction, so anybody seeking legal advice should consult with a professional who understands their specific circumstances and local laws.|"
Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	I am not a lawyer, but I can try to offer some general guidance based on the information you've provided. Firstly, it's important to note that as a limited company, your personal liability is generally limited to the company's debts and obligations. However, there are situations where directors can be personally liable for certain debts, such as if they have given personal guarantees for company loans or if there has been wrongful trading or fraudulent activity. Regarding the debt collection agency's claim, it's advisable to seek legal advice to assess the validity of the claim and the enforceability of the contract. If you believe that you have not breached the contract or that the terms are unfair or unreasonable, you may have grounds to dispute the debt and defend against any legal action. In terms of dissolving your company, it is generally possible to apply for voluntary strike-off or voluntary liquidation if the company is solvent and has no outstanding debts or liabilities. However, if there are outstanding debts, it may be more appropriate to consider other options such as a formal insolvency process like administration or liquidation. Consulting with an insolvency practitioner would be beneficial in determining the best course of action based on your specific circumstances. It's also worth noting that the process of winding up a company does not automatically extinguish or invalidate existing contracts, and any outstanding debts or obligations may still need to be addressed. Lastly, I would recommend seeking legal advice from a qualified professional who specializes in corporate insolvency to ensure you receive the most accurate and tailored advice for your situation. They will be able to assess your specific circumstances and provide guidance on the best course of action.	6.741786479949951	1	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section A16 (Moratorium)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|King v Anthony [1998] 2 B.C.L.C. 517 (Individual voluntary arrangements; Insolvency practitioners)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form DS02|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM23|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form IC02	"[[""Does the lawyer ask how the company was dissolved?"", ""Does the lawyer ask for the forms submitted for dissolving a company?"", ""Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

However, generally, in a professional setting, lawyers, when assisting in the process, may ask to review your company's dissolution forms to ensure everything is filled out correctly. Additionally, they may advise on supporting documents that might be required. It should also be noted that requirements may vary by jurisdiction, so it's recommended to consult with a legal professional in your area to understand the specific requirements and procedures.|The lawyer doesn't explicitly identify the different forms of liquidation, but mentions voluntary strike-off, voluntary liquidation, and administration as possible options for winding up a company. The lawyer also mentions the circumstances in which a company can move towards liquidation: when the company is solvent with no outstanding debts or liabilities, or if there are outstanding debts, a formal insolvency process might be more appropriate. The specific choice often depends on the company's financial situation and would require consultation with an insolvency practitioner.|In the provided response, the lawyer does not specifically refer to section 122 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (IA 1986). This section provides the grounds on which a company may be wound up by the court.

They state that while a person's liability is usually limited to the company's debts and obligations, there are exceptions, such as if a director has given personal guarantees for company loans or if there has been wrongdoing or fraudulent activity. The lawyer also mentions the potential for directors to be personally liable in the event of a company's insolvency.|No, the lawyer does not refer to any relevant case law in their response.|As an AI, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can tell you that the advice given seems to be solid, as it follows standard legal guidelines for businesses.

Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	If you are dissatisfied with the actions and decisions of the creditor committee and believe that changes need to be made, there are certain steps you can take to address your concerns. 1. Removing existing members and replacing them with others: a. Review the relevant governing documents, such as the company's articles of association or the terms of reference for the creditor committee. These documents may outline the process for removing and replacing committee members. b. Check if there are any specific grounds or procedures for removal outlined in the governing documents. In the absence of such provisions, general company law principles and the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 may apply. c. Hold a meeting of the creditors and propose the removal of specific committee members. This can be done by calling a creditors' meeting and obtaining the necessary voting majority to approve the removal. d. Ensure that the proposed replacements meet any eligibility criteria set out in the governing documents and obtain their consent to serve as committee members. e. Follow any notification or filing requirements set by Companies House or other relevant authorities when making changes to the committee membership. 2. Adding new members: a. Again, review the governing documents to determine if there are any provisions for adding new committee members. b. If permitted, propose the addition of new members at a creditors' meeting and seek approval from the other creditors. c. Ensure that the proposed new members meet any eligibility criteria set out in the governing documents and obtain their consent to serve on the committee. d. Comply with any notification or filing requirements when adding new members. 3. Seek legal advice: It is advisable to consult with a corporate insolvency lawyer who can review the specific circumstances and governing documents of your case. They can provide tailored advice and guidance on the best course of action, ensuring compliance with relevant statutes and legal obligations. Remember, the specific process for removing and adding members to a creditor committee may vary depending on the governing documents and the particular circumstances of the case. Seeking legal advice will help you navigate the process effectively.	8.738442420959473	1	The Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 section 17.8 (CREDITORS' AND LIQUIDATION COMMITTEE)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 301 (Bankruptcy)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 49 (Receivership)	Re Smile Telecoms SA [2022] EWHC 740 (Ch) (Business restructuring; Classes of creditors; Debt restructuring; Discretion; Expert evidence; Foreign companies; Cross-border insolvency; Opposition; Schemes of arrangement)|St George’s Property Services (London) Ltd (in admin.), Re [2011] EWCA Civ858 (Administration; Administrators; Administrators' powers and duties; Extortionate credit transactions; Removal; Replacement administrators; Unsecured creditors)|Lehman Brothers Int’l (Europe) (in admin.)

Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	Based on the information provided, it seems like the company is currently facing financial difficulties and may not be able to continue its operations in the long term. In this situation, you may consider the following options: 1. Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL): If both shareholders/directors agree to wind up the company voluntarily, you can consider an MVL. This is a formal process where a liquidator is appointed to wind up the affairs of the company, sell its assets, and distribute the proceeds to the shareholders. 2. Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL): If the company is unable to pay its debts and you want to wind up the company voluntarily, you can consider a CVL. This process involves appointing a liquidator who will realize the company's assets, settle its debts to the extent possible, and distribute any remaining funds to the creditors. 3. Dissolution: If the company has no debts and no assets, you may also consider applying for voluntary dissolution. This is a simpler process and does not involve appointing a liquidator. However, it is important to ensure that all creditors have been paid, as dissolving the company with outstanding debts can result in personal liability for the directors. It is advisable to consult with a solicitor or a licensed insolvency practitioner to discuss the specific circumstances of your company and determine the most appropriate course of action. They can guide you through the process, ensure compliance with legal requirements, and provide advice on the termination of the telecoms contract.	5.161887884140015	1	Companies Act 2006 section 3 (General introductory provisions)|Companies Act 2006 section 58 (A company's name)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Cheyne Finance plc (No 2), Re [2007] EWHC 2402 (Ch) (Notion of Insolvency; Cash flowS; Balance sheets; Debt; Receivership; Standard of proof)|Casa Estates (UK) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2014] EWCA Civ 383 (Notion of Insolvency; Balance sheets; Cash flows; Transactions at an undervalue)|Byblos Bank SAL v Al-Khudhairy (1986) 2 B.C.C. 99 (CA) (Notion of Insolvency; Winding-up orders)|BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7 (Creditors; Deeds; Distribution of assets; Equitable charges; Indemnities; Set-off; Subordination)|BNY Corporate Trustee Service ltd v Eurosail [2013] UKSC 28 (Notion of Insolvency; Crystallisation; Liabilities; Security)	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AA02|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form TM01|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form MT03	"[[""Does the lawyer say the company should not usually require liquidators purely for the reason of being unable to terminate the telecoms contract?"", ""Does the lawyer say that potentially, the company may face an insolvent liquidation if the telecom company refuses to compromise or if the contract is not assigned to a third party?

The most important advice is to consult with a solicitor or licensed insolvency practitioner to discuss the specific circumstances of the company.|Yes, the lawyer identifies two different forms of liquidation - Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL) and Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL). MVL is an option if both shareholders/directors agree to wind up the company voluntarily.

The lawyer is providing advice on voluntary procedures rather than compulsory winding up initiated by a court. Always remember it's best to check with a legal expert to comprehend your specific circumstances better.|Yes, the lawyer does outline when a company can be declared insolvent. According to the lawyer, this occurs when a company is unable to pay its debts. This typically leads to a Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL), where a liquidator settles the company's debts as far as possible by realizing the company's assets. If there are any remaining funds after the debts are paid, these are distributed among the creditors.|The lawyer does not explicitly reference sections 123-124 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (IA 1986) in his response. These sections provide a legal definition of insolvency and are often referred to when determining whether a company is insolvent. They lay out criteria like the company owing an undisputed debt of more than £750, the company's assets being outweighed by its liabilities, and the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due. While the lawyer doesn't directly mention these sections in his response, he does hint at their criteria when discussing situations in which the company might be unable to continue its operations or pay its debts.|No, the lawyer does not refer to any specific case law in this response. They provide general advice based on common business law practices and procedures relating to company insolvency and dissolution.|As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or experiences.

These include Member's Voluntary Liquidation (MVL), Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL), and dissolution. The lawyer also highlights the importance of seeking advice from a solicitor or licensed insolvency practitioner, due to the complex laws and procedures associated with winding up a company.|
Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	I am an AI language model and cannot provide legal advice. However, I can offer some general information that may be helpful. In this situation, it seems that you have missed the deadline specified in the lease agreement for exercising the break clause. The landlord is asserting that you are therefore liable for the remaining two years of the lease. The first step would be to carefully review the terms of the lease agreement to understand the exact requirements and consequences of exercising the break clause. It is essential to determine if there are any provisions for late notices or if strict compliance with the notice period is required. If strict compliance is required, it may be challenging to argue that you can still exercise the break clause. However, there are certain circumstances where a court may be willing to allow for flexibility. For example, if there was a clear prior understanding or agreement between both parties about your intention to terminate the lease early, it may be possible to argue that the landlord would not suffer any significant prejudice due to the late notice. It's important to note that the specific facts and circumstances of your case will play a significant role in determining the potential outcomes. It would be advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in commercial property or contract law to assess your options and provide tailored advice based on the specific details of your situation. Remember, this response is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as legal advice. Consulting with a qualified legal professional is always recommended in situations like yours.	4.945323944091797	1	Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 266 (Derivative claims and proceedings by members)|Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)	BTI 2014 LLC v Sequana SA [2016] EWHC 1686 (Ch) (Directors' powers and duties; Breach of fiduciary duty; Good faith; Fiduciary duty)|Lazari Properties 2 Ltd v New Look Retailers Ltd [2021] EWHC 1209 (Classes of creditors; Company voluntary arrangements; Coronavirus; Debt restructuring; Equal treatment; Landlords' rights; Material irregularity)|Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v PRG Powerhouse Ltd [2007] EWHC 1002 (Ch) (Company voluntary arrangements; Unfairly prejudicial conduct)	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM05|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM19|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form AM21		0.0		0	
Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	I am not a lawyer, but I can provide some general guidance on the options you may consider in your situation. It is always recommended to consult with a qualified insolvency professional or solicitor for specific legal advice tailored to your circumstances. 1. Assess the viability of the business: Before making any decisions, it is important to carefully evaluate the financial position and future prospects of the company. Consider factors such as cash flow, profitability, market conditions, and customer demand. If the business is no longer sustainable, it may be necessary to explore options for closure or sale. 2. Inform your accountant: Schedule a meeting with your accountant to discuss the financial situation of the company and potential options available. They will be able to provide advice specific to your business and help you navigate the necessary steps. 3. Company closure: a. Voluntary liquidation: You may consider voluntary liquidation, where the company's assets are realized and distributed to creditors in accordance with insolvency laws. This process allows for an orderly wind-up of the business. b.

Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided.

However, a lawyer should usually tell a company that if they are considering liquidation, the two main options in general are: 1. Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL): This is elected when the directors of the company believe the company can pay its debts within 12 months. It is a formal process that allows the directors to close the business and distribute its assets among shareholders. 2. Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL): On the other hand, this happens if the company is insolvent and cannot pay its debts. The shareholders of the company usually agree to put the company into liquidation and the assets are sold to repay creditors.

Your question would best be answered by having the actual context or text of the lawyer's statement. However, bankruptcy options available to directors usually include bankruptcy, entering into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), or creating a restructuring plan to manage debts. The best option would depend on the particular circumstances of the individual or company.|As an AI model, I'm unable to provide a complete lawyer's response without the context. But I can give you a general idea of how a lawyer might respond in such a case. It is very likely that a practicing lawyer would refer to the relevant sections of the Insolvency Act 1986 and Companies Act 2006 to provide an explanation of the available options concerning liquidation and restructuring. It is standard practice in legal discourse to refer to specific sections and clauses of the applicable law in detailing an explanation. For example, the Insolvency Act 1986 provides options such as Voluntary Arrangements (Part I), Administration (Part II), and Winding Up by the Court (Part IV). Similarly, relevant sections of the Companies Act 2006 may also come into the discussion, depending on the specifics of the restructuring or liquidation scenario under consideration. But for a detailed and specific answer that fits the context of your question, you need to consult a legal professional.|As an AI, I'll need the exact context or information provided by the lawyer to accurately answer your question. Without that context, I can't determine whether the lawyer mentioned the potential civil liability of the previous accountants or not. Could you please provide more context?|As an AI, I don't have the previous text to refer to, so I'm unable to confirm if the lawyer mentioned any specific information. However, I can provide general information on the topics you asked about. Under the Companies Act 2006 (UK), ss.171-177 do establish that company directors owe fiduciary duties to the company. These typically include the duty to act within their powers, promote the success of the company, exercise independent judgement, exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence, avoid conflicts of interest, and declare interest in proposed transactions or arrangements. In UK law, when a company becomes insolvent, the directors' duties shift from the shareholders to the creditors of the company. This is because in insolvency, the company's assets legally belong to the creditors. Therefore, directors should avoid any actions that could lessen the potential return to creditors. This could include refraining from entering into new commitments, properly recording all transactions, or stopping trading if it would only increase the net liabilities of the company. A failure to adhere to these duties may result in personal liability for company debts or disqualification as a director. It's always recommended for directors to seek professional advice when insolvency threatens.|As an AI, I don't have access to the specific context or responses you're referring to. Could you provide more details or context? It would certainly be within a lawyer's purview to discuss potential professional and personal consequences of disqualifying a company director, such as impacts on reputation, future employment opportunities, or even potential legal ramifications. However, without additional information, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question.|The consequences attached to Misfeasance (s.212 IA 1986), Fraudulent Trading (s.213 IA 1986), and Wrongful Trading (s.214 IA 1986) are quite serious and delicately tied to the duties of the directors of a company. They are designed to punish and provide sanctions against directors whose conduct falls below acceptable standards and cause loss to company's creditors. Misfeasance under s.212 IA 1986 refers to any breach of duty or misapplication of company's property resulting in loss to the company or its creditors. The consequences faced by directors in this case could be financial, and they may be held personally liable to restore any funds or property lost through their actions. Fraudulent Trading (s.213 IA 1986) occurs where it appears in the winding up of a company that any of its business has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors. The consequences are quite severe, including potentially unlimited personal liability, both civil and criminal penalties. The guilty party could also be disqualified from being a director for up to 15 years under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Wrongful Trading (s.214 IA 1986) occurs when the directors continue to trade when they should have known there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation. The consequences can be dire. Directors can be held personally liable to contribute towards the company's assets. Moreover, like in fraudulent trading, they may also face possible disqualification as directors under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. Bear in mind the complexities and intricacies of these provisions, and the strict liability they impose may greatly affect the decision making of the directors, particularly in a financially distressed company. It is important to obtain independent legal advice if there are any concerns in this regard. Keep in mind that this is just a general overview and does not constitute legal advice. Each case is unique and should be taken up with an experienced lawyer who can advise based on the specific circumstances.|Yes, indeed. According to sections 238-239, and 244-245 of the Insolvency Act 1986, transactions made at an undervalue or with a preference to certain creditors, which are made prior to a period of insolvency could be scrutinized, and potentially reversed if they're found to have been done with the intention of putting assets beyond the reach of creditors. Section 423 specifically refers to transactions defrauding creditors. These rules help ensure that all creditors are treated equitably in the event of insolvency. However, it's important to note that each case is assessed on its individual merits, so while there's a risk these transactions could be challenged, it is not automatic. Deciding if a transaction can be challenged depends on various factors, such as the solvency of the company at the time of the transaction, the intent behind the transaction, and the nature of the beneficiary. It's always advisable to obtain professional advice if you are in this situation. This response is for information purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Always consult with a legal professional for advice relevant to your circumstances.|As an AI, I can't provide a response without the actual context of the lawyer's statement.

Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	Under TUPE (Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006), the transfer of a business or undertaking can trigger the automatic transfer of employees to the new employer, along with their employment contracts and certain associated rights and liabilities. In the scenario you mentioned, where a new butcher is opening in the same premises soon after the previous butcher went into administration, TUPE may apply depending on the specific circumstances. TUPE can apply not only in cases where there is a change of ownership, but also in cases where there is a service provision change. A service provision change occurs when there is a change in the provider of a service, even if there is no change in ownership of the business or undertaking. This can include situations where a new business takes over the provision of services previously carried out by another business in the same sector and location. To determine whether TUPE applies in this situation, you would need to consider whether the new butcher is taking over the provision of services that were previously provided by the old butcher. This could include taking over customers, equipment, or other assets associated with the provision of the butcher's services. If there is a service provision change and TUPE applies, the employees of the old butcher would have their employment transferred to the new owner, along with their rights and obligations under their existing employment contracts. The new owner would generally be required to honor the terms and conditions of employment and may not dismiss employees solely because of the transfer. It is important to note that the specific circumstances of the case would need to be carefully considered, and it is always advisable to seek legal advice to determine whether TUPE applies in a particular situation.	6.965508222579956	1	Companies Act 2006 section 1204 (Business names)|Companies Act 2006 section 853C (Annual confirmation of accuracy of information on register)|Companies Act 2006 section 247 (A company's directors)	SSSL Realisations (2002) Ltd (in liq.), Re [2006] EWCA Civ 7 (Creditors; Deeds; Distribution of assets; Equitable charges; Indemnities; Set-off; Subordination)|Metro Nominees (Wandsworth) (No 1) Ltd v Rayment [2008] B.C.C. 40 (Administration; Breach of covenant; Business tenancies; Forfeiture; Permission)|Charnley Davies Ltd (No 2), Re [1990] B.C.C. 605 (Administration; Duty of care; Sale of business; Unfairly prejudicial conduct)	Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form MR02|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form PSC04|Here is a useful form from Companies House: Companies House Form PSC07		0.0		0	
Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?

However, if there's information you have about the context of the question, please provide it and I'll do my best to help you from there.|As a language AI model, I don't provide real-time responses. Nevertheless, a company can be declared insolvent under a number of circumstances. The most common is being unable to pay its debts as they fall due. This could occur due to a lack of cash, poor cash management, or if its liabilities exceed its assets. In most legal systems, insolvency initiates procedures such as bankruptcy (if an individual or sole trader) or liquidation / administration (if a company or corporation), designed to settle the insolvent entity's unpaid debts. However, it's advised to consult with a legal professional for specific contexts.|As an AI, I can tell you that whether a company is insolvent is typically assessed under the guidelines of specific laws or statutes. In the context of the UK law for example, sections 123-124 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provide indications of company insolvency. Section 123(1)(e) states that a company is deemed insolvent if it is proven to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due – the so-called 'cash-flow' test. Section 123(2) introduces the 'balance sheet' test, under which a company is also insolvent if the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities. Therefore, the relevant statutes are indeed crucial in determining whether a company is insolvent. However, you must consult with a professional lawyer before reaching any conclusions as each case involves different circumstances.|As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I don't have direct responses from specific professions. However, generally, in situations of insolvency, creditors often get paid in a particular order determined by the law depending on their claim's nature.

However, this could vary greatly depending on the specifics of the case and the jurisdiction. It's essential to consult with a lawyer for advice tailored to the specific circumstances.|Without any preceding text or context, it is impossible to determine whether the lawyer has mentioned the fiduciary duties directors owe to the company as per ss.171-177 CA 2006, or spoken about the directors’ duties when the company is insolvent.

Professionally, disqualification can last 15 years and during this time, the person can't be a director of a company, take part in forming, marketing, or running a company. They also cannot act as a receiver of a company’s property. Personally, the individual may have to provide compensation to creditors if their conduct contributed to the company's insolvency. It can also have significant impacts on their personal reputation which can limit future business or employment opportunities. This disqualification gets registered which can be accessed by the public, potential employers and business partners. However, without the context of the specific case, these consequences could vary.

We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.

However, in general, under the Companies Act 2006 (UK), directors do owe fiduciary duties to the company they serve, not the partnership. These duties, codified in sections 171 to 177, include the duty to act within powers, to promote the success of the company, to exercise independent judgment, to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence, to avoid conflicts of interest, not to accept benefits from third parties, and to declare an interest in a proposed transaction or arrangement. The applicability of these duties to specific cases would depend on the exact circumstances and the law's interpretation.|As a legal professional, I can explain the provisions of the sections you've mentioned, however, I need to clarify that the consequences for breach of these provisions can vary based on the specific circumstances of each case, jurisdiction, and individual judge's ruling. Section 212 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (IA 1986) deals with misfeasance. Directors found guilty of this can be compelled to repay, restore, or contribute such sums to the company’s assets by way of compensation as the court thinks just. Section 213 of the IA 1986 regards fraudulent trading. If it appears that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud creditors of the company or creditors of any other person, or for any fraudulent purpose, the court can declare that any persons who were knowingly parties to the carrying on of the business in such a manner are to be liable to make such contributions to the company’s assets as the court thinks proper. Section 214 deals with wrongful trading. If in the course of the winding up of a company it appears that section 214(1) applies in relation to a person who is or has been a director of the company, the court, on the application of the liquidator, can declare that that person is to be liable to make such contribution to the company’s assets as the court thinks proper. Aside from financial consequences, the director may also be disqualified from holding directorships in the future under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. This disqualification can last for up to 15 years. In some severe circumstances, fraudulent and wrongful trading can also involve criminal penalties, including potential imprisonment. The specific consequences are typically determined by the courts on a case by case basis considering various factors. Remember, it's essential to seek professional legal advice for the specifics of a case.|As an AI, I don't have access to the lawyer's previous statements, so I can't tell if they specifically referred to that provision. However, section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986 is indeed a key legislation concerning transactions defrauding creditors in the UK. It allows a court to unwind transactions at an undervalue, or those intended to put assets beyond the reach of someone who is making or may at some time make a claim against the debtor. If you have specific questions about this provision or your situation, it would be best to consult directly with a legal professional.|Apologies for any misunderstanding, but as an AI model, I will need more context to answer your question effectively. Are you asking for a hypothetical situation where a director gets disqualified? The personal and professional consequences could vary depending on several factors such as the reasons for disqualification, the contractual provisions in their service agreement or company's bylaws, the relevant laws in the jurisdiction, among other things. Broadly speaking, disqualification can adversely impact a director’s reputation personally and professionally and limit their future employment opportunities. It also might trigger clauses in their employment contract, leading to termination, forfeiture of certain benefits, or even personal liability in some cases. However, specific consequences would depend on the particulars of the case and professional advice from a lawyer should be sought.|As an AI model, I'm unable to provide the previous context or lawyer's response. However, generally speaking, yes, formalities need to be fulfilled before a partnership can be struck off the Companies House registry. This can include settling any debts, closing down any operations of the firm, and ensuring that all necessary notifications have been made. It may differ depending on the jurisdiction so it's advisable to consult with a legal professional.|As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I must clarify that I can't refer to or provide a response based on the previous context as your message is auto-generated and doesn't contain a question or a lawyer's response on which I could comment.

Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	As a corporate insolvency lawyer, I can provide you with some general guidance about prioritizing your payments in the winding up process of your limited business. However, please note that this advice is not a substitute for professional legal advice. I recommend consulting with an insolvency practitioner or a qualified insolvency lawyer for specific advice tailored to your situation. In the winding up process, there is a specific order of priority for distributing the assets of the company. This order of priority is set out in the Insolvency Act 1986 and includes the following categories: 1. Fixed charge holders: If you have any secured creditors who have a fixed charge over specific assets of your company, they will have first priority to those assets. 2. Costs and expenses of the winding up: Any costs and expenses incurred in the winding up process, including professional fees and the costs of the liquidation, will have priority before other debts. 3. Preferential creditors: Certain creditors, such as employees with outstanding wages and certain tax authorities, may have preferential status and will be paid before unsecured creditors. 4. Floating charge holders: If there are any creditors with a floating charge over the company's assets, they will have priority to those assets after the costs and expenses of the winding up and preferential creditors have been paid. 5. Unsecured creditors: Unsecured creditors, such as suppliers and trade creditors, will generally be paid next in line, after the costs and expenses of the winding up, the preferential creditors, and the floating charge holders have been satisfied. Please note that the actual distribution and priority of payments may depend on the specific circumstances of your case and any relevant agreements or arrangements. As for your specific situation, it	7.427110195159912	1	Companies Act 2006 section 251 (A company's directors)|Companies Act 2006 section 154 (A company's directors)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 124 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 123 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)|Insolvency Act 1986 section 122 (Winding Up of Companies Registered under the Companies Acts)	Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services [2011] UKSC 38 (Anti-deprivation principle; Good faith; Priorities; Order of distribution; Security)|Salomon v Salomon & Co.

He generally refers to the priority of payments under the Insolvency Act 1986 but doesn't mention any specific sections.|No, the lawyer does not identify the powers the courts have when hearing an insolvency petition in this response. They only discussed the order of priority for distributing the assets of a company during the winding up process.|The lawyer did not specifically mention sections 125-128 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in their response. They did reference the Insolvency Act in a general context, but did not delve into specific sections. If you wish for information relating to these specific sections, I recommend you ask the lawyer directly as they likely have relevant knowledge and expertise.|No, the lawyer does not outline the specific circumstances for a company to be declared insolvent in this response. They are providing a general order of priority for payments in the winding up process of an already insolvent limited company. For specifics about when a company can be declared insolvent, a professional insolvency practitioner or lawyer should be consulted.|The lawyer does not explicitly reference these sections of the Insolvency Act 1986 in their response. However, they do note that the order of priority for distributing assets is set out in the Insolvency Act 1986. The lawyer advised seeking professional guidance for a tailored advice to the specific situation, implying that the intricacies such as specific statutes or sections of the law would be best handled by an insolvency lawyer or qualified insolvency practitioner who would reference and interpret relevant sections such as ss. 123-124 IA 1986 directly relevant to the situation.|Yes, the lawyer outlines the order of priority in which creditors should typically be paid during the process of winding up a company. The order he suggests is based on the Insolvency Act 1986 and generally includes fixed charge holders, winding-up expenses, preferential creditors, floating charge holders, and unsecured creditors, in that order. However, he also notes that this may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case.|Yes, the lawyer does say to pay secured creditors before unsecured creditors. The secured creditors mentioned include those with a fixed or floating charge over the company's assets, and they should be paid before unsecured creditors such as suppliers and trade creditors.|No, the lawyer does not refer to any relevant case law in their response. They only refer to the Insolvency Act 1986 which sets out the order of payment priority.|As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to provide advice or validate factual information with real-time data. However, the response provided by the lawyer in this text aligns with general principles of law relating to corporate insolvency in many jurisdictions. The assertion that payments should be prioritized according to the order dictated by the Insolvency Act 1986 (applicable in the UK) is correct as it specifies payment to fixed charge holders, costs of the winding up, preferential creditors, floating charge holders, and then unsecured creditors. However, the actual order of priority may vary depending on the specific laws of a particular country or jurisdiction. Therefore, it's always crucial to consult with a professional legal advisor or insolvency practitioner to get accurate and situation-specific advice.|
