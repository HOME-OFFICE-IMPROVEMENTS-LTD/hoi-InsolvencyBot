Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	This is a complex situation that requires careful handling. Here's some advice: 1. Document everything: - Keep copies of all correspondence - Take photos of the note and keys - Keep records of when and how they were delivered - Save any previous communications about your resignation and stock transfer 2. Regarding the stock transfer: - Check if the form was actually filed with Companies House - Request confirmation of the filing status - Keep copies of the signed stock transfer form 3. Director status: - Check your status on Companies House website - If you're still listed as a director, you technically still have responsibilities - Only a proper resignation filing can remove you as a director 4. Immediate actions: - Do not handle any company assets or make any business decisions - Return the keys via recorded delivery as planned - Write a formal letter/email documenting that you're returning the keys and rejecting any authority over company matters 5. Legal protection: - Consider seeking legal advice, particularly from a corporate lawyer - They can help ensure you're properly removed from the company - They can advise on protecting yourself from potential liabilities 6. Communication: - Keep all communication in writing - Be professional and maintain records of all interactions - Consider having a lawyer review any correspondence before sending Remember: Don't take any actions regarding company assets or decisions until you've clarified your legal position, preferably with professional legal advice.	6.213371276855469	1
Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	Here are several steps you can consider taking: 1. Legal Action: - Your partner can file a claim through HMRC's National Minimum Wage complaints system if the non-payment puts them below minimum wage - File a claim through the Employment Tribunal if within 3 months of the non-payment - Make a claim through the Small Claims Court (Money Claim Online) 2. Documentation: - Gather all evidence of work done (timesheets, contracts, communications) - Keep records of all attempts to contact X - Document any verbal agreements or promises made 3. ACAS: - Contact ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) for free advice - They can help mediate the situation before going to tribunal 4. Industry Bodies: - Contact relevant construction industry bodies or unions for advice - Consider reporting X to trade associations they belong to 5. Regarding the main house builder: - You can contact them, but legally they might not be directly responsible - However, they might be interested to know about issues in their supply chain - This could put pressure on Y and X 6. Additional Support: - Contact StepChange or Citizens Advice for debt advice - Apply for Universal Credit if eligible - Contact your local council for emergency support 7. Professional Help: - Consider consulting an employment lawyer (many offer free initial consultations) - Some unions offer free legal advice even if you join after the incident The main house builder might care about their reputation, so it's worth contacting them, but focus primarily on legal routes to recover the money from X, as they are directly responsible for the payment.	7.253610849380493	1
Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	I understand you're in a very difficult and stressful situation. While I can provide some general information, it's crucial that you seek professional legal advice immediately from a solicitor specializing in insolvency and corporate law. Here are some initial thoughts: 1. Immediate Actions: - Don't make any hasty decisions - Document everything - Gather all relevant paperwork regarding both companies - Don't agree to anything with the liquidators without proper legal advice 2. Legal Options to Consider: - Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) - Restructuring plans - Refinancing options - Negotiating with creditors - Alternative dispute resolution 3. Professional Support: - Contact a licensed insolvency practitioner for a second opinion - Seek advice from a corporate restructuring specialist - Consider consulting a business rescue expert - Contact organizations like Business Debtline or R3 for guidance 4. Personal Support: - Contact mental health support services - Speak with family and trusted friends - Consider professional counseling Resources: 1. Business Debtline: 0800 197 6026 2. Samaritans: 116 123 (24/7 support) 3. R3 (Association of Business Recovery Professionals) Remember: There are often more options available than might be immediately apparent. Don't give up - seek professional help first. Would you like me to provide more specific information about any of these aspects?	8.586282014846802	1
Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"No, company assets cannot be seized to pay a personal debt. This is because a limited company is considered a separate legal entity from its directors and shareholders, even in the case of a sole director. This is known as the ""corporate veil"" or ""separate legal personality."" Key points: 1. Company assets belong to the company, not to the director personally 2. Creditors cannot seize company assets to settle personal debts 3. The only assets that can be seized are those personally owned by the individual However, there are some exceptions: 1. If the director has given personal guarantees for company debts 2. In cases of fraud or wrongful trading 3. If company assets have been deliberately transferred to avoid paying personal debts 4. If the corporate veil can be ""pierced"" due to improper conduct The best way to protect both personal and business assets is to: - Keep personal and business finances strictly separate - Maintain proper company records - Follow proper corporate governance procedures - Avoid mixing personal and business assets"	4.150773525238037	1
Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	"Based on your situation, here are some key points to consider: 1. Limited Liability Protection - If your company was properly set up as a limited company, you are generally protected from personal liability for business debts - Personal assets that belonged to you before the company (and weren't transferred to the company) remain yours 2. Debt Collection Tactics - Debt collectors often use pressure tactics - Their suggestion to ""find money from somewhere"" is not your legal obligation - You are not personally liable for the company's debts unless you signed a personal guarantee 3. Dissolution Process - Creditors can object to the dissolution - If they do, you may need to either: - Deal with the debt - Consider formal insolvency proceedings - Or negotiate a settlement 4. Practical Steps: - Check if you signed any personal guarantees with Utility Bidder - Keep all correspondence - Don't make any promises to pay - Consider seeking free advice from Business Debtline or Citizens Advice - If the debt is genuinely disputed, communicate this in writing If there was no personal guarantee and the company has no assets, you can generally proceed with dissolution. The debt collectors may continue to chase, but they cannot force you personally to pay company debts."	6.0004026889801025	1
Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	The ability to modify a creditor committee's composition depends on several factors. Here's a general guidance: 1. Legal Framework: - Creditor committees are typically governed by insolvency/bankruptcy laws - The formation and modification process should follow legal requirements - Court supervision may be required for changes 2. Possible Actions: For Removing/Replacing Members: - Gather evidence of the committee's failure to act in creditors' best interests - File a motion with the bankruptcy court - Demonstrate valid reasons for removal (e.g., conflicts of interest, negligence) - Propose qualified replacements For Adding New Members: - Submit a formal request to the court - Demonstrate why additional members are necessary - Show how new members would benefit creditors' interests Recommended Steps: 1. Consult a bankruptcy attorney 2. Document all concerns about current committee 3. Gather support from other creditors 4. Follow proper legal procedures for filing motions 5. Ensure proposed changes comply with relevant laws Note: Specific procedures may vary by jurisdiction and case circumstances. Legal counsel is strongly recommended.	5.501909494400024	1
Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	In this situation, you have a few options to consider: 1. Voluntary Strike Off: - If the telecoms contract is the only liability, you could attempt to negotiate a settlement - However, creditors can object to the strike off and force the company into liquidation 2. Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL): - This would be the proper legal route if you cannot pay all liabilities - The telecoms company would become an unsecured creditor - A liquidator would handle the formal termination of contracts 3. Pre-pack Administration: - This might be excessive for your situation given the single liability Given your circumstances: - The telecoms contract is a significant liability - You're otherwise debt-free - All tax obligations would be met Recommendations: 1. First, try to negotiate one final time with the telecoms provider 2. Seek professional advice from an insolvency practitioner 3. If negotiation fails, CVL might be the cleanest solution to deal with the telecoms contract The risk of trying to strike off with an outstanding contract is that the telecoms company could force you into compulsory liquidation, which is more expensive and complicated. Consider consulting an insolvency practitioner for specific advice based on your exact circumstances.	5.508726358413696	1
Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	"This is a complex situation with several important factors to consider: 1. Legal Position: - Break clauses typically require strict compliance with notice periods - Courts generally treat these requirements as mandatory - The fact you're 7 days late could legally invalidate your break notice 2. Mitigating Factors: - Prior discussions with landlord about leaving - Landlord's active involvement in arranging viewings - These actions could potentially constitute a waiver or estoppel 3. Possible Arguments: - The landlord's conduct in arranging viewings might suggest they accepted your intention to leave - There could be an argument for ""reasonable notice"" given the prior communications - The landlord's knowledge of your intentions might be relevant Recommendations: 1. Seek immediate legal advice from a property lawyer 2. Gather all documentation of prior communications and viewings 3. Try to negotiate with the landlord, possibly offering some compensation for the late notice 4. Consider whether there are any other breaches by the landlord that could help your position While you're technically in breach of the notice requirement, the prior discussions and landlord's actions might give you some leverage for negotiation. A legal professional can best advise on your specific circumstances."	5.35322380065918	1
Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	Based on your situation, here are some potential options and steps to consider: 1. Initial Steps: - Meet with your accountant as planned - Get a clear picture of all assets, liabilities, and contractual obligations - Document everything thoroughly - Stop taking on new commitments/orders 2. Potential Options: A. Voluntary Liquidation (CVL): - Most common route for insolvent companies - Professional liquidator appointed - Orderly wind-down of business - Protection from personal liability (except guaranteed debts) B. Pre-pack Administration: - If business has salvageable elements - Sell assets/business to new company - Could preserve some value/relationships C. Attempt to sell the business: - Might be difficult given current performance - Could explore selling customer list/goodwill - Consider competitor businesses as potential buyers 3. Specific Considerations: For BBL (£14k): - Personal liability exists - Consider negotiating payment plan - Document all attempts to pay For Overdraft (£6k): - Priority due to personal guarantee - Use asset sales to clear if possible For Lease Cars: - Check termination clauses - Negotiate early termination if possible - May need to be part of liquidation process 4. Immediate Actions: - Stop personal guarantees on new commitments - Preserve cash where possible - Keep detailed records - Maintain communication with creditors - Consider seeking professional insolvency advice 5. Professional Help: - Licensed Insolvency Practitioner consultation - Legal advice regarding personal guarantees - Continue working with accountant Remember: - Act in creditors' best interests - Keep good records - Don't take on new debt - Be transparent with stakeholders - Consider your mental health and wellbeing Would recommend speaking with: 1. Your accountant 2. Licensed Insolvency Practitioner 3. Business Debtline (free advice) 4. Consider joining FSB (Federation of Small Businesses) for support The key is to act early while you still have options and assets to work with.	9.969405174255371	1
Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	Based on your situation, here's some advice: 1. Seek Professional Help: - Consult an insolvency practitioner for a second opinion - Speak with a qualified business lawyer - Consider getting independent financial advice 2. Regarding Illegal Dividends: - Document when and how you discovered the issue - Gather all correspondence with your previous accountants - You may have a professional negligence claim against them - Consider whether their professional indemnity insurance could help 3. Options to Consider: - Negotiate with creditors for a payment plan - Look into a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) - Consider a Time to Pay arrangement with HMRC - Explore selling or restructuring the business 4. Important Points: - Keep detailed records of everything - Don't take on new debt or make preferential payments - Continue trading only if it's viable and not worsening the situation - Act quickly as directors' duties change when insolvency threatens 5. Personal Bankruptcy Alternatives: - Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) - Debt Management Plan - Informal arrangements with creditors Consider contacting: - Business Debtline - Citizens Advice - A licensed insolvency practitioner for free initial advice - The Institute of Chartered Accountants regarding the previous accountants' conduct Remember: Acting promptly and seeking professional advice can help identify more options than you might realize.	8.039242029190063	1
Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	"TUPE can apply in situations where a business operates from the same premises as a previous business, but it's not automatic just because it's the same location and sector. This would be considered a ""business transfer"" under TUPE only if there is a transfer of an ""economic entity that retains its identity."" For TUPE to apply, typically there needs to be: 1. A transfer of significant assets (equipment, stock, etc.) 2. And/or transfer of customers/contracts 3. And/or continuation of the same or similar business activities 4. Taking on the same or similar workforce In your butcher shop example, TUPE would only apply if: - The new business takes over significant assets from the old business - Continues similar activities - Takes on customers/goodwill - Plans to employ the same or similar workforce If the new butcher is simply renting the same premises but starting completely fresh with: - New equipment - New suppliers - New customer base - No connection to the previous business Then TUPE would likely not apply. Each case needs to be assessed on its specific circumstances. If workers are unsure, they should seek legal advice or contact ACAS."	5.528310298919678	1
Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	I understand this is a difficult situation. Based on your description, here are some key points to consider: 1. Regarding Strike-off: - You can apply for voluntary strike-off if your company meets certain conditions - The company must not have traded or sold off any stock in the last 3 months - You must notify all interested parties (including HSBC) within 7 days of applying - The strike-off notice will be published in the Gazette 2. Bounce Back Loan considerations: - Having a BBL doesn't automatically prevent strike-off - HSBC's supportive stance is positive - The fact that the BBL was used legitimately for business purposes is important 3. Recommended steps: - Get everything in writing from HSBC regarding their position - Ensure all tax affairs are up to date with HMRC - File all outstanding accounts and confirmation statements - Keep records of all communications and business documents 4. Timeline: - After applying for strike-off, it typically takes at least 3 months - Companies House will publish the strike-off notice - If no objections are received, the company will be dissolved Given HSBC's supportive stance and the relatively small BBL amount, voluntary strike-off might be appropriate. However, it would be wise to: 1. Get professional advice if possible 2. Get HSBC's position in writing 3. Document everything thoroughly Have you considered seeking advice from a licensed insolvency practitioner for a free initial consultation?	7.012804746627808	1
Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	This is indeed a complex situation. Here's a breakdown of key points and advice: 1. Evidence and Documentation: - Keep detailed records of the cash discrepancies - Document all communications about the issue - Maintain copies of bank statements and cash records - Save any written admissions of wrongdoing 2. Legal Position: - The breach of partnership agreement terms regarding cash handling and record-keeping provides grounds for expulsion - In a two-partner partnership, expulsion would indeed lead to dissolution - The non-compete and goodwill clauses in your agreement should protect your interests 3. Dissolution Process: - Consider seeking legal advice before proceeding - Follow the dissolution procedures outlined in your partnership agreement - Document all assets and liabilities - Get professional valuation if needed - Consider having an accountant review the books 4. Continuing the Business: - You can continue as a sole trader - The non-compete clause should prevent them from setting up nearby - If the business name is registered to the partnership, you may need to address this 5. Practical Steps: - Secure all business assets and records - Change banking arrangements - Inform key stakeholders (suppliers, landlord, etc.) - Consider the employee's position 6. Goodwill/IP: - If the partnership agreement excludes goodwill rights after expulsion, this strengthens your position - Document any pre-existing IP you brought to the business Given the circumstances and their admission of effectively misappropriating funds, you're in a strong position to end the partnership. However, consider getting legal advice to ensure the process is handled correctly. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?	7.84827184677124	1
Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	When winding up a limited company, there is a specific order of priority for paying creditors. Here's how you should approach this: Priority order: 1. Secured creditors (not applicable in your case) 2. Preferential creditors (employees - not applicable in your case) 3. Unsecured creditors (utilities, broadband, etc.) 4. Directors' loans (lowest priority) With your £600, you should: 1. First pay the utilities (especially energy), as these companies have more robust debt collection procedures 2. Then water 3. Then broadband What happens with unpaid debts: - The debts belong to the company, not you personally (unless you've signed personal guarantees) - Creditors can chase the company but not you as an individual - They may try to prevent the company from being struck off if there are outstanding debts - In worst cases, they could force the company into liquidation Recommendations: 1. Contact all creditors and explain the situation 2. Try to negotiate reduced final payments 3. Get everything in writing 4. Keep detailed records of all communications and payments 5. Consider seeking professional advice for the formal dissolution process Remember: As long as you haven't signed personal guarantees or acted fraudulently, your personal assets should be protected due to limited liability.	5.56585431098938	1
