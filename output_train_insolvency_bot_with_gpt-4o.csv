Q1	I left a position a couple of months ago after a disagreement with the other director on the direction of the company. I signed a stock transfer form a month ago to return the 5% I had in the business and assumed it was dealt with after I was told it would be filed and I would be removed. Today, the other director dropped the keys for the offices rented by the business and a note saying I was never taken off of the business and to sell all of the assets, close down the business and pay off the debts (along with sending the other director some money). It came a bit out of left field and I'm fairly new to business but I assumed when I signed that form it removed all of my permissions from doing anything with company assets or filings? Any advice would help as I currently don't know what to do other than send the keys back recorded delivery so I cannot be accused of theft or anything.	In your situation, several legal issues arise regarding your involvement with the company and its current status. Here’s a breakdown of steps and considerations for you to take: 1. **Check the Stock Transfer**: First, confirm whether the stock transfer form you signed was duly processed. Just signing the form doesn’t suffice; the transfer must be registered in the company’s register of members, and the company's records at Companies House need to be updated. You can check the public register at Companies House to see if your resignation as director and the change in shareholding have been filed. If not, you are still officially a shareholder and potentially a director. 2. **Directorship Status**: Check the official records to confirm whether you are still listed as a director. If you are still a director, you're legally responsible for the company’s actions under the Companies Act 2006. Resigning as a director involves submitting a form TM01 to Companies House. If this hasn't been done, you might still bear responsibilities. 3. **Company Insolvency**: If the business is insolvent (unable to pay its debts), as a director, you must not allow the company to continue trading as this could lead to personal liability for debts incurred (wrongful trading). You should seek immediate advice from an insolvency practitioner regarding the company’s financial position. 4. **Asset Management**: Since you were given the keys and instructions to handle the company’s assets, it’s crucial to ensure that any actions taken comply with legal obligations. Selling company assets to pay off debts must be done in a manner that maximizes returns for creditors, typically requiring professional guidance. 5. **Communication with the Other Director**: Contact the other director to clarify your position and ensure all necessary documentation is filed to reflect your current status. Written communication is advisable to have a record of all exchanges. 6. **Seek Professional Advice**: Given the complexity and potential personal liability, consult with a solicitor specializing in company law or an insolvency practitioner. They can provide specific guidance, help with necessary filings, and advise on the liquidation process if appropriate. 7. **Return of Keys**: Your idea to return the keys via recorded delivery is prudent. Document your actions and communications to protect against any claims of misconduct or negligence. 8. **Potential Legal Claims**: If you remain a director, be aware of director duties under the Companies Act 2006, including acting in the company’s best interest, avoiding conflicts of interest, and exercising due care and diligence. Failure to adhere to these duties could lead to personal liability or disqualification from acting as a director in the future. Remember, acting quickly and seeking professional advice is crucial to mitigate risks and ensure compliance with legal obligations.	15.622254610061646	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q2	Hi, I hope someone can help advise as Citizens advice are a 14 day turn around and I feel so angry and stressed. My partner was working for a subcontractor I will refer to as X and he subcontracts from Y who then subcontracts from a massive house builder in the UK. X had been booking in work with Y and the work hadn't been done so when Y found out they said he wouldn't be getting anymore more money to pay his 13 guys wages. So now my partner hasn't been paid £1800 after tax becuase of this. Apparently X doesn't have the money and he owes Y over £30k. My partner has tried to contact X and be reasonable about it but he started off saying my partner was at the top of his priority list and he would be paid the money, it is now 3 weeks later and X is ignoring calls and texts. Never in our lives have we struggled like this, we are a large family my partner and I have 8 children together and have now had to use a food bank for the last 2 weeks which we have never had to do as we have been pay check to pay check since covid as we didn't take any of the gouverment grants and this has massively set us back. Please can someone help, what can we do, can I persue X, Y and the massive UK house builder? Should I call. The massive UK house builder and speak to them and let them know the kind of guy that has been subcontracted? Would they even care? We can't let this just be accepted as a loss of £1800 as its put us in debt and it has really affected our family massively. Many Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to read and respond.	"I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation your family is facing. In the UK, there are legal steps you can take to try to recover the unpaid wages. Here's a straightforward breakdown of your options: 1. **Determine the Employment Relationship:** - First, identify if your partner is an employee or a subcontractor. The legal remedies available may vary depending on this classification. If your partner receives a regular wage and has an employment contract, he may be considered an employee. If he works on a contract basis and issues invoices for work completed, he may be a subcontractor or self-employed. 2. **Contact X Formally:** - If X is not responding to informal communication, send a formal letter or email demanding payment. This is often called a ""Letter Before Action."" In this letter, specify the amount owed, reference any agreements or contracts, and state a deadline for payment (usually 14 days). Make sure to keep a copy of this correspondence. 3. **Consider Legal Action Against X:** - If X continues to ignore your demands, you can pursue legal action through the small claims court for amounts up to £10,000. This process is relatively straightforward and doesn't necessarily require a solicitor. You can start the claim online through the [UK Government's Money Claim Online](https://www.gov.uk/make-money-claim) service. 4. **Assess Liability of Y and the Main Contractor:** - Generally, your partner would have a direct claim against X if he was contracted by X. It may be possible to argue that Y or the main contractor has some liability, particularly if there was a contractual obligation not fulfilled. However, without a direct contractual relationship, it may be challenging to hold Y or the main contractor liable. - Contacting the main contractor directly to inform them of the situation might not result in immediate payment but could put pressure on X if they wish to maintain a good relationship with their subcontractors. 5. **Check for Insolvency Proceedings:** - If X is unable to pay due to insolvency, you might need to check if they are in administration or liquidation. You can search for this information on the [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house) website. If X is insolvent, you may need to file a claim as a creditor. 6. **Seek Assistance from Advisory Services:** - While you're waiting for Citizens Advice, consider reaching out to organisations like ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) for free advice, especially if employment rights are involved. They can be reached through their helpline at 0300 123 1100. 7. **Consider Financial Assistance:** - In the meantime, explore what financial assistance might be available for your family. This might include benefits or emergency grants. Your local council or Citizens Advice can provide guidance on what support you may access. Remember that legal processes can take time, and it's important to document all communications and steps you've taken. Although it may be frustrating, persistence is key. I hope this helps, and I wish you the best in resolving this matter."	18.283485889434814	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q3	Good Evening, I am in an extremely difficult situation and I'm looking for a specialist lawyer who can help me with the following: Company A is a trading company that has been in business since 2008 and has been liquidated in 2023. Company B is a property company that has been in business since 2020. We are currently in liquidation with Company A, and one of the creditors is a bank due to an RLS loan. This loan is a cross-guarantee, which means that in case of liquidation, the property company is liable to pay this amount. Background: Company A gave an intercompany loan to Company B to facilitate the purchase of an industrial unit. As Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner will be asking for the loan amount to be repaid. This means that not only is Company B liable to pay the RLS, but they will also be liable to pay the intercompany loan along with the mortgage on Company B. This puts Company B in a difficult position, and the liquidators are putting pressure on them and asking to put Company B into administration with them. This way, they can sell the industrial unit and I will lose everything I have worked for over the last 17 years. I am here to get some advice, help, and support, but I feel like I have lost it all. Is there any point in carrying on....?	I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you're facing. It’s important to approach this systematically to understand your options and protect your interests as much as possible. **1. Understanding the Cross-Guarantee and RLS Loan:** - The cross-guarantee means that Company B is responsible for Company A's loan obligations if Company A cannot meet them. The Recovery Loan Scheme (RLS) is a government-backed loan, and ensuring its repayment is a priority for creditors. - It's crucial to review the terms of the cross-guarantee and the RLS loan agreement to understand the extent of Company B's liability. Consulting with a solicitor who specializes in insolvency law can help clarify these details. **2. Intercompany Loan:** - Because Company A is in liquidation, the insolvency practitioner is obligated to recover as much as possible for the creditors, which includes reclaiming the intercompany loan from Company B. - You may want to explore whether there are grounds to negotiate a repayment plan or potentially contest any terms if they were not properly documented or agreed upon. **3. Administration Considerations:** - Entering administration can be a strategy to protect Company B from immediate creditor pressure and allow for a restructuring or sale of assets in a controlled manner. However, it can also lead to the sale of assets, such as your industrial unit, to repay debts. - An alternative to administration could be a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which might allow Company B to continue trading while repaying its debts over time. This requires creditor agreement but could be a more favorable option. - It's critical to assess whether Company B has any viable future trading prospects or assets that could be leveraged to satisfy creditors without going into administration. **4. Personal Implications and Actions:** - If you have personal guarantees tied to these loans or debts, it’s important to understand the implications and seek legal advice on how to protect your personal assets. - Engaging a solicitor or insolvency practitioner who can advocate for your interests is vital. They can negotiate with creditors and possibly explore restructuring options that could alleviate the immediate pressure. **5. Statutory and Case Law References:** - The Insolvency Act 1986 governs the liquidation and administration process in the UK, providing the framework for how insolvency practitioners must act. - The Enterprise Act 2002 introduced reforms to the administration process, focusing on rescuing viable businesses. - Relevant case law might include situations involving cross-guarantees and intercompany loans, but specific case references would require a detailed legal analysis of your situation. **6. Practical Steps:** - Obtain detailed legal advice from a specialist insolvency lawyer. Look for firms with strong backgrounds in corporate insolvency. - Consider whether a restructuring expert could assist in negotiating with creditors or exploring alternative financial arrangements. In such complex situations, ongoing professional support is invaluable. While the situation is challenging, there may still be options to mitigate losses and protect your interests. Remember, seeking timely legal advice could make a significant difference in the outcome.	19.762731790542603	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q4	I know that LTD company debts, stay with the LTD company, and a personal individual cannot be chased for this. What happens when it's the other way round. A personal debt against an individual who is the sole director of multiple LTD companies? Can company assets be seized to pay a personal debt?	"In the UK, limited companies (LTDs) are considered separate legal entities from their directors and shareholders. This means that the company's assets are distinct from the personal assets of its directors and shareholders. Therefore, if an individual, who happens to be the sole director of several limited companies, incurs personal debt, the general rule is that creditors cannot seize the assets of those limited companies to satisfy the individual's personal debts. Here are the key points to consider: 1. **Separate Legal Personality**: Under the Companies Act 2006, a limited company is a separate legal entity from its directors and shareholders. This principle was established in the landmark case of *Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd* [1897] AC 22. This means that the liabilities of the individual are separate from the company's liabilities. 2. **Protection of Company Assets**: Since the company is a separate legal entity, its assets are protected from being used to satisfy the personal debts of its directors. Creditors of the individual generally have no claim over the company's assets. 3. **Exceptions - Piercing the Corporate Veil**: In rare cases, courts might ""pierce the corporate veil,"" which means they disregard the separate legal personality of the company. This could happen if there is evidence of fraud, wrongful trading, or if the company is merely a façade for the individual's actions. However, such cases are exceptional and must meet a high threshold of proof. 4. **Personal Guarantees**: If the individual has provided a personal guarantee for any debts or obligations of the company, then they may be personally liable for those specific debts, but this does not allow creditors to directly seize company assets. 5. **Bankruptcy of the Individual**: If the individual is declared bankrupt under the Insolvency Act 1986, their personal assets are used to pay their debts. However, this does not extend to the assets of any limited companies they are associated with unless there is a legal basis to do so. 6. **Insolvency Proceedings**: If a director is bankrupt, they may face restrictions in acting as a director of a company without the court’s permission. This is separate from the issue of asset seizure but is worth noting. 7. **Official Forms**: If bankruptcy proceedings are initiated against the individual, forms such as a ""Bankruptcy Petition"" (Form 6.27) might be relevant, but these relate to personal insolvency proceedings, not the company’s situation. In summary, the assets of a limited company are generally protected from being used to satisfy the personal debts of its directors due to the principle of separate legal personality. If you face such a situation, it would be wise to consult with a solicitor specializing in insolvency to explore all potential implications and ensure compliance with legal obligations."	18.75065040588379	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q5	"I posted a thread s few weeks back about ""closing my ltd company and who to pay"" and got some really helpful advice. Today I got a phone call from a debt collection agency, on behalf of Utility Bidder ( a comparison site for business energy) who I went thru when energy prices were rising and I wanted to secure the best price. Apparently I have broken the contract by not seeing out the whole 3 yr term and they're chasing me for about 1k inc vat. I told him I had applied to companies House to dissolve the company and he told me I wouldn't be able to because I have this outstanding debt with them and I should see an insolvency practitioner. When I told him that I wasnt going to spend 2k+ to settle a 1k debt ,he suggested a payment plan. I asked for time to get some advice because obviously the company has no money with which to pay. He suggested that I should ""find the money from somewhere"". I was a very small bakery and essentially all the equipment was mine, most of it I owned before I set up, some I bought but with my own money, and I used the company money to buy mainly ingredients and small things like replacement knives/bowls. I stopped trading on 24th Dec, I gave notice on my unit and moved out on 18th Jan. I have not traded since and there is no outstanding payments due for goods i supplied. Do I just stick to my guns and let it run its course till they run out of steam?"	"Based on your situation, here’s some guidance on how to handle the outstanding debt and the dissolution of your company: 1. **Outstanding Debt and Dissolution**: - If your company has an outstanding debt, it can complicate the process of dissolving it. According to the *Companies Act 2006*, particularly Section 1004, a company cannot be dissolved if there are outstanding debts or other liabilities. If you attempt to dissolve the company without addressing the debts, creditors can object to the dissolution. - It's important to understand that, while you might not want to incur further costs, ignoring the debt could lead to further complications, such as the creditor applying to court to have the company wound up. 2. **Options for Dealing with the Debt**: - **Negotiate**: As the debt collection agency suggested, you can try negotiating a payment plan that the company can manage. This might be a more cost-effective option than engaging an insolvency practitioner. - **Insolvency Practitioner**: While the cost might seem high, consulting with an insolvency practitioner can provide you with a clear understanding of your legal obligations and options. They can advise whether a formal insolvency procedure (like a Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation) is necessary or if there are alternative solutions. - **Statutory Demand**: Be aware that if the creditor is serious about collecting the debt, they might issue a statutory demand. If unpaid, this could lead to a winding-up petition. It's crucial to address any statutory demands promptly. 3. **Personal Liability**: - Since you mentioned that much of the equipment was owned personally before the company was formed, it’s important to ensure that any assets legally belong to you personally and not the company. This distinction can be crucial if the company enters into liquidation. - As a director of the company, you generally aren’t personally liable for the company's debts unless you have given a personal guarantee or have engaged in wrongful or fraudulent trading. 4. **Next Steps**: - **Consultation**: It may be beneficial to have a brief consultation with a solicitor or an insolvency practitioner just to get specific advice tailored to your situation. Some practitioners offer free initial consultations. - **Formalize Your Position**: If you decide not to engage an insolvency practitioner, ensure you maintain clear records of all communications and any agreements made with creditors. 5. **Forms and Further Actions**: - If you proceed with the dissolution, ensure the submission of Form DS01 to Companies House, but be aware of the creditor's right to object. - If you choose to go through a voluntary liquidation, you'll need to involve an insolvency practitioner to handle the process. In summary, while letting the situation ""run its course"" is an option, it could lead to less control over the outcome. Engaging with the creditor and possibly consulting an insolvency expert could offer a more structured resolution to your situation."	17.104969024658203	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q6	A creditor committee had been formed a few months ago in a quick time, without involving any voting or consent from the creditors. We have found the creditor committee is not doing thing for the best interest of the creditors. We may take the following action. 1. To remove some existing members and to be replaced by some others. 2. To add some new members. Can we do it and how can we do it? Thanks	In the UK, the establishment and operation of a creditors' committee are governed by the Insolvency Act 1986 and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016. A creditors' committee is typically formed in certain types of insolvency proceedings, such as administration, liquidation, or bankruptcy, to oversee the conduct of the insolvency practitioner and assist in the proceedings. ### Formation and Responsibilities 1. **Formation**: A creditors' committee is usually formed at a meeting of creditors. The Insolvency Rules 2016 state that at least three and not more than five creditors are elected to the committee. This election is typically conducted through a vote, where creditors present or represented at the meeting cast their votes. 2. **Responsibilities**: The committee's primary role is to act in the interest of all creditors, overseeing the insolvency process and assisting the insolvency practitioner with their duties. ### Making Changes to the Creditors' Committee If you believe the current committee is not acting in the best interests of the creditors, you can take steps to change its composition. Here’s how you can proceed: 1. **Calling a Meeting**: - Under **Rule 17.4 of the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016**, creditors can request the convening of a meeting if they represent at least 10% in value of the total creditors. - This meeting can be used to discuss concerns about the current committee and propose changes. 2. **Voting on Changes**: - At the meeting, creditors can vote to replace existing committee members or add new members. - Any changes to the committee should be made by a majority vote of the creditors present or represented at the meeting. 3. **Removal of Members**: - The committee itself can vote to remove a member by a majority decision, as long as there is still a quorum (at least three members) after the removal. 4. **Adding New Members**: - New members can be added by creditor vote. However, the total number of committee members must not exceed five. ### Considerations - **Notice Requirements**: Ensure proper notice of the meeting is given to all creditors, usually at least 14 days in advance, unless otherwise specified. - **Documentation**: Use the appropriate forms, such as **Form 8.2 (Notice of Creditors' Meeting)** when calling a meeting. - **Legal Advice**: It may be prudent to seek legal advice or consult with an insolvency practitioner to ensure compliance with all procedural requirements. This process ensures that the committee represents the interests of the majority of creditors and operates effectively within the framework of UK insolvency law.	17.013776540756226	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q7	We have a ltd company with 2 shareholders/directors. Unfortunately over the last year work has really quietened down. Also the other shareholder/director would like to leave the company for new ventures. This would leave us in a position where the business could no longer carry on. We have no debt and no overdrawn directors accounts. we didn't take any bounce back loans. All vat bills would be paid as would Cox. The only thing we wouldnt have enough money for is to terminate our telecoms contract which has 7 years left. (they are completely unreasonable and not budging) Would we require liquidators purely for this reason? Thanks.	In your situation, you are contemplating the potential winding up of a company that is not burdened with debt, except for a telecoms contract, which you find financially challenging to terminate. Since you have no significant liabilities or insolvency issues, you may not necessarily require formal liquidation through the appointment of a liquidator. Here are some options and considerations: 1. **Members' Voluntary Liquidation (MVL):** - This process is applicable when a company is solvent, meaning it can pay all its debts in full within 12 months. Since you mentioned that the company has no debts, this could be a suitable option if you wish to formally wind up the company. - An MVL requires a declaration of solvency by the directors (Companies Act 2006, section 89). This declaration must be made before a notary or solicitor. - You will need to appoint an insolvency practitioner to act as the liquidator, who will oversee the distribution of any remaining assets to shareholders. 2. **Negotiate with the Telecoms Provider:** - Before proceeding with a formal liquidation, it might be worth attempting one final negotiation with the telecoms provider. Sometimes, companies are willing to negotiate a reduced settlement or termination fee, especially if the contract becomes unsustainable. - Consider engaging in mediation or seeking advice from a solicitor who specializes in contract law, to explore alternative dispute resolution options. 3. **Company Dissolution:** - If the only significant issue is the telecoms contract and the company is otherwise solvent, you might consider applying for a voluntary strike-off (Companies Act 2006, section 1003). - To strike off the company, you would need to complete and submit Form DS01 to Companies House, signed by a majority of the directors. - Note that creditors, including the telecoms provider, can object to the strike-off if they believe they are owed money. This process may not relieve you of contractual obligations without the creditor’s consent. 4. **Consult Legal Advice:** - Given the potential complexity of contractual obligations, it may be beneficial to seek advice from a solicitor with expertise in corporate and contract law. They can provide guidance specific to your contractual obligations and help assess any potential risks or liabilities. 5. **Consider the Contract Implications:** - Review the terms of the telecoms contract. There may be a clause that allows for early termination under certain conditions, or you might have a right to assign the contract to another party if the business is sold or transferred. In summary, while you may not need a liquidator if you choose a voluntary strike-off, you should consider the implications of the telecoms contract and whether an MVL might be a more appropriate route if you foresee any complications. Consulting with a legal professional could provide tailored advice for your specific circumstances.	14.453187227249146	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q8	We've screwed up. We informed our landlord that we would like to execute a break clause in our lease (5 year contract with a 3-year break). As per our lease agreement, we need to provide the landlord at least 3 months notice on the break. We informed them 7 days too late to conform to that requirement (i.e. we've given them 2 months and 3 weeks notice). The person this fell to was out-of-action last week, when they were supposed to do this. Landlord is holding this against us, saying that we are too late, and are liable for the final 2 years. Note, we'd discussed this with the landlord several months ago, that we were looking to get out of the lease sooner as we no longer had enough space to operate effectively. The landlord even arranged viewings for prospective tenants. But we did not formally request it until today (too late). Where do we stand on this?	In this situation, you are dealing with the strict interpretation of a break clause in a lease agreement. Generally, break clauses must be exercised in strict accordance with the terms set out in the lease. This includes providing the exact notice period required, which, in your case, was 3 months. Missing the deadline by even a small margin, such as 7 days, can result in the break notice being invalid. 1. **Legal Position**: - **Strict Compliance**: UK courts have consistently upheld the principle that break clauses must be adhered to strictly. This was established in cases such as *Mannai Investment Co Ltd v Eagle Star Life Assurance Co Ltd* [1997] AC 749, where it was affirmed that notices must be clear and comply with the conditions set out in the contract. - **Consequences of Non-Compliance**: If the notice is not given in accordance with the lease terms, the break clause is not validly exercised, and you remain bound by the lease for its full term. 2. **Possible Solutions**: - **Negotiation**: Since you had previous discussions with the landlord and they even facilitated viewings, there may be room for negotiation. Approach the landlord and explain the situation, emphasizing your prior discussions and their involvement in arranging viewings. They might be willing to accept the late notice if they are confident of finding a replacement tenant. - **Mutual Surrender**: Propose a mutual surrender of the lease. This would involve both parties agreeing to terminate the lease early. You might need to offer some financial consideration (e.g., covering rent until a new tenant is found) to the landlord. - **Find a Replacement Tenant**: If the landlord is open to negotiation, you could assist in finding a new tenant to take over the lease. This might make the landlord more amenable to accepting the late notice. 3. **Documentation**: - Make sure any agreement reached with the landlord is documented in writing and signed by both parties to ensure enforceability. 4. **Legal Advice**: - Given the potential financial implications, it would be prudent to seek legal advice from a solicitor who specializes in property law. They can help you explore all possible options and negotiate with the landlord on your behalf. In summary, while your position is technically weak due to the late notice, the landlord's prior conduct and any potential willingness to negotiate could provide a pathway to resolving the situation amicably.	9.364829778671265	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q9	Business has been a LTD Company since 2014 with good trading history in retail/B2B. Like many we suffered during covid after being closed and not being able to trade as normal. We restructured in some ways but still required retail store. We have recently had to close the retail store Nov 22 to reduce costs and restructure our customer base more towards B2B clients. After 3 months trading from a new non retail location we have come to the conclusion the business is no longer viable for various reasons. Business has 2 equal directors. BBL Natwest balance around £14k which has been paid consistently until Jan when we had to take a payment holiday to help with cash flow. We have an OD with bank of around 6K which has a directors guarantee, we could probably cover this with sale of assets. CH & HMRC in good order. A few outstanding invoices from the closure retail store for around 7K, asset sale won't cover. Two lease cars both with 1 year each left on lease but leased via LTD company with no directors guarantee that we can see in the paperwork. Our customer base has pretty much dried up and the customers we do have are being very careful on what they spend since cost of living issue hit the media, so although we are trading we struggle with cash flow on a daily basis. I know these amounts are not huge but we feel like we are fighting a loosing battle and want to look at options of closing the business or selling it and moving on. But have no idea where to start. This I'm sure is a very common story after recent events and I never thought I would ever be even contemplating these options but it feels like the only option. Have read a few posts and seen the SpongeBob post but don't know what to do for best. Have a meeting with accountant soon to discuss but would be great-full for any advise. TIA	I'm sorry to hear about the challenges your company is facing. It's clear that you've worked hard to keep the business afloat, but sometimes closing or restructuring is the most prudent decision. Below are some options and steps you may consider, with references to relevant UK insolvency law and procedures: 1. **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA):** - A CVA is a formal agreement with your creditors to pay back a portion of your debts over time. It allows you to continue trading while restructuring your debts. - This is governed by Part 1 of the Insolvency Act 1986. You'll need to propose a CVA through an Insolvency Practitioner (IP). - This option can be complex and requires creditor approval, but it might be suitable if you believe the business can become viable again with some adjustments. 2. **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** - If you believe the business is no longer viable, a CVL might be the appropriate route. This involves winding up the company voluntarily with the aid of an IP. - Directors can nominate an IP to act as a liquidator, who will then sell the company's assets and distribute the proceeds to creditors. - Reference: Sections 84-98 of the Insolvency Act 1986. - This process will also address the company's debts, like the Bounce Back Loan (BBL) and overdraft, although personal guarantees on the overdraft will need to be settled personally. 3. **Dissolution and Strike Off:** - If the company has no outstanding debts (or minimal debts that can be settled), you might consider applying for the company to be struck off the Companies Register. - This is a simpler process but not suitable if there are significant debts or disputes with creditors. - Reference: Sections 1000-1001 of the Companies Act 2006. - Form DS01 is used for applying for voluntary strike-off. 4. **Administration:** - Administration could be an option if you think the business could be sold as a going concern, or if you want to protect it from creditors while restructuring. - The administration process is governed by Schedule B1 of the Insolvency Act 1986. - An administrator is appointed to manage the company's affairs, business, and property. 5. **Lease Agreements:** - Since the lease cars are in the company’s name with no personal guarantees, these could be returned to the leasing company. However, check the lease agreement for any early termination fees or penalties. 6. **Director’s Duties:** - Be mindful of your duties as directors under the Companies Act 2006, especially the duty to act in the best interests of creditors when the company is insolvent or nearing insolvency (Section 172). 7. **Seek Professional Advice:** - It's crucial to consult with an accountant or insolvency practitioner. They can help assess the company's financial situation, explain the implications of each option, and guide you through the process. 8. **Personal Guarantees:** - Since there is a personal guarantee on the overdraft, ensure you have a plan to settle this, perhaps through the sale of personal or company assets. Given the complexity of insolvency matters, engaging with an IP is advisable. They will help you navigate the legal requirements and ensure compliance with all statutory obligations, ultimately assisting in making the process as smooth as possible for both directors and creditors.	17.19821333885193	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q10	Hi everyone, long time lurker here. Fortunately, I've never needed to read this subsection until now! Bit of a backstory: I've been running a limited co for 6 years now, I've always had a bit of a hard time getting a hold of the accountants despite paying monthly retainers but the last couple of years have been particularly bad, late filings, no call backs and so on. I've recently switched to a new practice who have reviewed my accountants in full and immediately flagged a horrific situation. The accounts were a mess. The tax liabilities were much higher than expected and it turns out, I've unknowingly taken illegal dividends to the sum of 35k. I've spoken to a local liquidator who has stressed that this needs handled and I will be forced into personal bankruptcy, no question. I have no assets, everything was sold to keep the business going post-covid. Beyond the dividends, I owe personal tax. There's about 15k worth of equipment in the business and cash in the bank or due in. The top line has done well over the years but in the current climate, it will be almost impossible for the company to earn its way out of things. I'm wondering if there's any independent advice I could get? I'm terrified that if I go bankrupt, it will ruin my future prospects and could have been avoided. Thanks	I'm sorry to hear about your situation. It sounds like a challenging time, but there are steps you can take to address these issues. Here’s a breakdown of what you might consider: 1. **Illegal Dividends**: In the UK, dividends can only be paid out of profits available for the purpose, as per the Companies Act 2006, particularly sections 830 and 847. If you’ve taken dividends when the company did not have distributable profits, these are considered illegal. Directors can be required to repay these to the company, especially in insolvency situations. 2. **Company Insolvency**: Given the financial state of your company, you may need to consider whether the company is insolvent. This means it cannot pay its debts as they fall due, or its liabilities exceed its assets. The process of dealing with this could include: - **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL)**: If the company is insolvent, a CVL might be appropriate. This involves appointing a liquidator to wind up the company's affairs. You mentioned consulting a liquidator, which is a good step. - **Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA)**: This is another insolvency procedure where the company enters into an agreement with its creditors to pay back a portion of its debts over time. 3. **Personal Bankruptcy**: If you’re unable to repay personal debts, bankruptcy might be a consideration, but it should usually be a last resort due to its significant impact on your credit rating and future financial activities. You may want to consider: - **Debt Management Plan (DMP)**: An informal agreement with creditors to pay back debts at a rate you can afford. - **Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA)**: A formal agreement to pay back debts over a period of time, which can prevent you from being declared bankrupt. 4. **Seek Professional Advice**: It’s crucial to get tailored advice from an insolvency practitioner or a solicitor specializing in insolvency law. They can provide detailed guidance based on a full understanding of your situation. 5. **Reporting to HMRC**: Since there are tax liabilities involved, it’s important to communicate with HMRC. They may have payment plans available to help manage the tax debts. 6. **Director Disqualification**: Be aware that directors of insolvent companies can face disqualification proceedings if found to have acted improperly. However, proactive steps to address the situation and cooperation with creditors can be mitigating factors. 7. **Review of Accountant’s Conduct**: If your previous accountant’s conduct contributed to your current situation, you might have grounds to file a complaint with a relevant professional body or consider legal action for negligence. For forms and further information: - **Form 4.19**: This is used for a statement of affairs in a company liquidation. - **Insolvency Service**: They provide guidance and resources for individuals facing financial difficulties. Remember, while online advice can be useful, it’s important to consult directly with professionals who understand the intricacies of your specific situation.	13.932382106781006	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q11	I know TUPE applies when a business changes hands. I seem to remember reading TUPE also applies if an unrelated business takes over the premises of another business in the same sector and trades from the same location - is that correct? Example in our town. Butchers gone in to administration, staff left in limbo, talk that a new butcher will be opening in the same premises soon. Would TUPE apply in those circumstances?	"The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, commonly known as TUPE, is designed to protect employees' rights when the business they work for changes hands. Under TUPE, employees of the original business automatically become employees of the new owner, with their existing terms and conditions of employment intact. However, for TUPE to apply, there must be a ""relevant transfer,"" which is essentially a transfer of an economic entity which retains its identity. This usually involves the transfer of significant business assets, such as the workforce, equipment, or client base, rather than just premises. In the scenario you've described, where a new butcher opens at the same premises previously occupied by a butcher that went into administration, the application of TUPE would depend on several factors: 1. **Transfer of Assets:** If the new butcher business has acquired significant assets from the previous butcher, such as equipment or stock, this might indicate a relevant transfer. 2. **Transfer of Employees:** If the new butcher employs a significant number of the same staff from the previous butcher, this too could suggest a transfer of an economic entity. 3. **Continuation of Business:** The new business would need to operate in a manner that is similar to the previous business, not just in the same location. If the new butcher is merely leasing the premises and starting a completely independent operation, without taking on the previous business's employees, equipment, or clientele, then TUPE is unlikely to apply. A relevant case that illustrates this is *Abler v Sodexho MM Catering Gesellschaft mbH [2004] ECR I-5617*, where the European Court of Justice ruled that the transfer of tangible and intangible assets was critical to determining whether a TUPE transfer occurred. In your specific example, if the new butcher is simply occupying the same physical location without any continuity in business operations or retention of employees from the old butcher, TUPE would not typically apply. However, if there is any doubt, it might be wise to consult with an employment law expert or a solicitor to assess the specific facts of the case. If TUPE does apply, then certain procedures must be followed, including informing and consulting employees. The applicable form for employee liability information, although not a statutory form, is often referred to as an ""Employee Liability Information"" form, which helps ensure the new employer has all necessary details about transferring employees. In conclusion, the applicability of TUPE in your scenario would depend on whether the new butcher is essentially continuing the old business, beyond just using the same premises."	17.229248523712158	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q12	Hi there, I wonder if anybody else has been through this and can shed some light on it, So we've been trying to save our business and we've come to terms to realise with world events we cannot continue the company is effectively dead as we sold a luxury not a need. However HSBC have been very supportive and we told them we cannot pay and they said they do a long term no affordability. Send a few letters tick a few boxes they have said in a nutshell. The bounce back loan at the moment is on a payment holiday. So costing us very little a month. I have to give credit to HSBC and their support and advice. But it's the question of how the company is closed. However when do we strike the company off normally my main question? We have no money to liquidate and it and HSBC said they wouldn't liquidate it either for a 12k bounce back loan. We had our total bounce back loan on designing a new product for our company and buying stock for it. Not ever used for personal consumption. Will the company be left in limbo and then companies house eventually strike off, we owe nobody else apart from bounce back loan and I've put my own money into company to try and save it but we have to come to the terms that the world events cost of living have killed our business. It's a real heart breaking situation having owned this company since 2012: but the world has changed. I feel allot of hurt personally. Thanks everybody. Has anybody else been through the process?	I'm sorry to hear about the difficult situation you are facing with your business. Closing a company can indeed be a challenging process, especially when financial difficulties arise. Here's a plain English guide to help you understand your options for closing your company in the UK, focusing on the situation you've described. ### Options for Closing the Company 1. **Strike Off (Voluntary Dissolution):** - If your company has no debts other than the Bounce Back Loan, you may consider applying for a voluntary strike off. This process is governed by the Companies Act 2006. - To initiate a voluntary strike off, you need to complete and submit Form DS01 to Companies House. This application must be signed by a majority of the directors. - However, before applying for a strike off, you must inform all creditors, including HSBC, of your intention. Given that you have a Bounce Back Loan, you need to ensure there are no objections from HSBC. - It's important to note that a company cannot apply for strike off if it has traded or changed its name in the last three months, or if it is subject to any ongoing insolvency procedures. 2. **Creditors' Voluntary Liquidation (CVL):** - Although you mentioned that you lack funds to liquidate, a CVL is still an option if the company is insolvent and cannot pay its debts. This process involves appointing an insolvency practitioner to liquidate the company, sell its assets, and distribute the proceeds to creditors. - In some cases, directors may need to personally fund the initial costs of a CVL; however, it is important to discuss this with an insolvency practitioner who might be able to offer flexible payment options. 3. **Compulsory Liquidation:** - This is usually initiated by creditors but can also be pursued by the directors themselves if necessary. It involves a court order to wind up the company. - Given HSBC's stance, it seems unlikely they would pursue compulsory liquidation for the Bounce Back Loan. ### Considerations - **Bounce Back Loan:** - The Bounce Back Loan scheme was designed to be more lenient than other types of loans. Lenders like HSBC may have their own policies regarding the pursuit of debt recovery in these circumstances, which can sometimes be more accommodating. - **Directors' Responsibilities:** - Ensure you fulfill your duties as a director by acting in the best interests of creditors once the company is insolvent. Failing to do so can lead to accusations of wrongful trading. - **Personal Contributions:** - Any personal funds you have put into the company may be claimed as a creditor, but typically, shareholders rank behind other creditors in any distribution of assets. ### Emotional Impact It's completely understandable to feel heartbroken in this situation. You are not alone, and many business owners are facing similar challenges due to global events. It might be helpful to speak with an insolvency practitioner who can provide tailored advice and support through this process. They can also help you understand any potential personal liabilities and assist with completing the necessary documentation. ### Next Steps - **Consult an Insolvency Practitioner:** They can provide detailed advice specific to your situation and help explore your options. - **Communicate with HSBC:** Keep open communication with your bank to ensure they are aware of your intentions and to understand their requirements or possible objections to your chosen route. - **Prepare and Submit Form DS01:** If you choose voluntary strike off, ensure all necessary notifications are completed, and file the form with Companies House. By taking these steps, you can navigate the process of closing your company with greater clarity and compliance.	27.322773694992065	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q13	Sorry, bit of an essay, I am looking for some advice on a partnership matter. I am in a general partnership with one other; running a small retail shop. I manage nearly all the admin, finances etc, we both work in the shop and have one employee. We have managed to pay ourselves monthly drawings from profits for our time since we opened a few years ago, with a small additional profit on top most years. Drawings are related to hours worked and I get extra for admin time, though this generally doesn't accout for all the time I spend. I recently completed our tax return and became suspicious of our bank balance - we had a healthy buffer following the covid grants but this has gradually been eroded, and I have expressed concern to them several times, assuming that we were struggling and suggesting we might not be able to pay ourselves at the usual rate. We have a system whereby both partners are responsible for banking cash - we record amounts taken and are meant to record when they are paid in. My partner is very slack with record keeping and rarely fills in the paying in records or passes on paying in slips, and often needs prompting to pay in cash at end of month. I finally managed to check back through records we have both filled in for cash taken and payments received to bank - I know I should have done it sooner - and there is almost a £3000 shortfall in what they have recorded as taken and what they have paid in over last two years. When challenged they sent a letter apologising profusely saying they had got behind with paying in and record keeping, needed to borrow some cash, lost track of how much and basically panicked and buried head in sand and always intended to pay it back, but the reality is the money has been steadily taken over a two year period - generally something is paid in but has been short of what was actually taken from the till. They said they always intended to pay it back, but could never work it out and just ignored it, in hope that at some point they would be able to deal with it, and could never find the right time to tell me. I feel I am being taken for a mug. Alongside this they have proved to be pretty erratic in general - poor communication, record keeping and making silly errors (though some now seen more suspicious) which have cost us money. I end up spending a lot of time trying to track down errors or clear up the mess their errors cause, which has been quite stressful. They have quite a turbulent personal life which exacerbates errors and often precludes discussions about finances and procedures. My discovery of the shortfall comes at a time of personal crisis for my business partner which I have every sympathy for, but I am hurt and angry that they basically took cash from the business and let me stress about our finances without telling me that they had “borrowed” the cash. I have decided I no longer trust them and no longer want to be in the partnership - but am getting severe emotional blackmail from them regarding their personal situation and their involvement in the business. My questions are really about the technicalities of how to end it - we have a fairly thorough partnership agreement of which several terms with regard to paying in, handling cash and record keeping have been broken, so it would seems I have grounds to expel them, but as a two partner partnership, presumably this would result in instant dissolution too? The partnership deeds also have clauses relating to setting up similar businesses and lack of entitlement to goodwill following expulsion. Ideally my intention is to continue the business alone, but I am just looking for advice on potential pitfalls in the process of expulsion and dissolution that might arise, or potential problems regarding me taking on the business alone. I am anticipting working out balances owed either way and potentially may even have to buy them out of the assets, but am unclear about how the “goodwill” side of things works and if they have any claim to the name/intellectual property etc. And also am looking for reassurance.	Ending a partnership can be a complex process, especially when relationships have deteriorated and financial issues are involved, such as the unauthorized withdrawal of funds by your partner. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate this situation: 1. **Review the Partnership Agreement**: - Your partnership agreement is key. It will typically outline the procedures for expelling a partner, dissolution, and the distribution of assets. Given the breaches you mentioned regarding cash handling and record keeping, you may have grounds to expel your partner under the terms of your agreement. - Check for any clauses that specify the process for dissolution and any restrictions on setting up a similar business post-dissolution. 2. **Expulsion and Dissolution**: - In a two-person partnership, expelling one partner effectively leads to dissolution unless the partnership agreement provides otherwise. - The Partnership Act 1890 governs partnerships in the UK when the partnership agreement does not address certain issues. According to Section 32(c) of the Act, a partnership is dissolved if it is unlawful for the business or for the partners to carry it on in partnership. 3. **Goodwill and Intellectual Property**: - Goodwill refers to the value of the business reputation and customer relationships. Your partnership agreement states that the expelled partner is not entitled to goodwill, which suggests that you may not have to compensate them for this aspect. - For intellectual property, check your agreement for any specific terms. If not covered, generally, any intellectual property developed during the partnership is owned by the partnership, and its division would be part of the dissolution process. 4. **Financial Settlements**: - Calculate the partnership’s assets and liabilities. This includes determining any amounts your partner owes due to the unauthorized withdrawals. - You mentioned potentially buying them out. This would involve negotiating a settlement where you pay them for their share of the partnership assets, minus any amounts they owe. - Ensure that all financial settlements are documented clearly to avoid future disputes. 5. **Legal Advice and Mediation**: - Given the complexities, it would be wise to seek legal advice to ensure you’re following the correct process and protecting your interests. - Consider mediation as a way to resolve disputes amicably. It can be less costly and faster than court proceedings. 6. **Notification and Compliance**: - Notify HMRC about the dissolution of the partnership. You’ll need to settle any outstanding tax liabilities and close any partnership accounts. - Inform your bank and other relevant parties about the dissolution and any changes in business structure. 7. **Continuing the Business Alone**: - If you wish to continue the business, you may need to establish a new legal entity, such as a sole proprietorship or a limited company. - Consider the implications for contracts, leases, and other agreements that were in the partnership’s name. 8. **Emotional and Practical Considerations**: - Be prepared for emotional challenges. Ending a partnership can be stressful, especially when personal relationships are involved. - Document everything to protect yourself legally, and try to keep communications professional and focused on resolving the partnership issues. 9. **Future Restrictions**: - Pay attention to any non-compete clauses or restrictions on setting up a similar business, as stipulated in your partnership agreement. Ensure you comply with these to avoid legal issues. Ultimately, while this situation is challenging, by following the legal framework and seeking professional advice, you can work towards a resolution that allows you to continue your business with greater peace of mind.	20.425498723983765	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
Q14	I'm in the process of winding up my limited business (only me and wife are directors with no employees). For my customers I officially stopped on 24th December but moved out of my premises on 18th Jan. My landlord was OK about me not being able to pay the rent and we agreed I'd get out pretty quick. I have no debt (like official bank loans or BBL except directors loans - amounting to a couple of thousand) apart from my latest direct debits for energy, water and broadband. Energy is probably the biggest as I paid every quarter - that falls this month. I have £600 left in the business account - who do I prioritise and what will happen when they chase me for any remainder?	In winding up your limited company, it's important to follow a structured process to ensure compliance with UK insolvency laws and to minimise any potential liabilities for you and your wife as directors. Here’s a step-by-step guide: 1. **Determine Solvency**: Since you only have a few outstanding debts and some funds available, your first step is to determine if your company is solvent. A company is solvent if it can pay its debts as they fall due. Given your scenario, it appears your company might be insolvent, as you cannot cover all outstanding debts with available funds. 2. **Settle Debts**: Start by prioritising your debts. You should first cover any debts that are classified as priority or essential: - **Energy bills**: These should be a priority if the services are still being used. If the business is inactive and no services are being used, negotiate with the supplier. - **Other suppliers**: If there are any services that are essential for winding up or de-registering the business, consider settling these. 3. **Directors’ Loans**: As directors, you and your wife rank as unsecured creditors. Repayment of these loans should be considered only after settling priority debts. 4. **Communicate with Creditors**: Contact your creditors, including utility providers, to explain your situation. They may be willing to negotiate partial payments or offer a payment plan. It’s often more beneficial to reach an agreement than to leave debts unsettled. 5. **Consider a Voluntary Dissolution**: If the company is insolvent but has minimal debt, you might consider applying for a voluntary dissolution under Section 1003 of the Companies Act 2006. Ensure all company affairs are settled before applying. 6. **Insolvency Proceedings**: If the company is unable to pay its debts, a Creditors’ Voluntary Liquidation (CVL) might be the appropriate process. This involves appointing an insolvency practitioner to manage the liquidation. The Insolvency Act 1986 governs this process. 7. **Filing Forms**: If you decide to dissolve the company, you’ll need to complete and file Form DS01 with Companies House. Ensure all creditors are notified at least seven days before submitting this form. 8. **Directors’ Responsibilities**: As directors, you have a duty to act in the best interest of creditors once the company becomes insolvent. Failing to do so can lead to personal liability for company debts under wrongful trading provisions (Insolvency Act 1986, Section 214). 9. **After Dissolution**: Once the company is dissolved, creditors can no longer chase the company for debts. However, if the dissolution is done improperly, it can be reversed, and creditors can still pursue debts. 10. **Seek Professional Advice**: Given the intricacies involved in winding up a company, especially regarding potential insolvency, consider consulting with an insolvency practitioner for tailored advice. By prioritizing essential payments and communicating with creditors, you can navigate the winding-up process more smoothly.	16.172846794128418	1	Insolvency Act 1986	Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd	Form 4.19 (Scot)
