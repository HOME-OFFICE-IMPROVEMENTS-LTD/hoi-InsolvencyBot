Q1	I have been the director of three companies over the last few years: Motor Racing Limited, Car Racing Limited, and Classic Racing Limited. The first two have gone into liquidation six months ago. Am I allowed to continue trading with the third company?	Yes, you should be able to continue trading with the third company, Classic Racing Limited, unless you've been disqualified as a director or the third company is also facing financial difficulties. If all your duties as a director were carried out correctly and you weren't found to be at fault for the collapse of the first two companies, you usually can carry on trading. However, all situations are unique. Always consult with a legal professional or a financial adviser to understand any potential risks or complications.	7.643978595733643	1	"[[""Does the lawyer mention that this may be a phoenix company?"", ""Does the lawyer mention Insolvency Act 1986 section 216?""], [3, 3]]"	0	[0, 0]	6	No, the lawyer does not mention anything about this being a phoenix company.|No, the lawyer does not mention the Insolvency Act 1986 section 216.|
