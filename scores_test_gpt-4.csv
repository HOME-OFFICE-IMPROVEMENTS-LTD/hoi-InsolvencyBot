Q1	I set up a limited liability company in 2015. My business suffered greatly during the Covid-19 pandemic, and it still hasn’t recovered yet. I fell into arrears, and one of my suppliers submitted a winding-up petition against my business. A friend of mine is willing to invest money in my company. Do I have good chances of avoiding a liquidation order if my friend commits to pumping money into my business?	While it may improve your situation, it is important to note that having an investor willing to put money into your business does not automatically guarantee that you will avoid a liquidation order. There are several factors that can influence the decision, including the size of the debt, the overall financial situation of your company, and potential for recovery. Typically, a winding-up petition is submitted by a creditor when a company owes them money and has not been able to make payments. If the court believes that your company is insolvent and has no realistic chance of being able to pay its debts, a liquidation order may still be made. In this context, having a person willing to invest in your business could help demonstrate to the court that your business does have a chance of becoming profitable again. It could potentially be used as evidence during a court hearing to challenge the winding-up petition or request for an adjournment or for the petition to be dismissed. However, it's important that the potential investor's commitment is substantial and verifiable, as the court will want to see concrete evidence that your company's financial situation can improve. In such a complex situation, the best course of action would be to seek out professional legal advice. An experienced insolvency lawyer will be able to assess your circumstances and guide you on what to do next.	26.37042617797852	1	"[["" Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

Q2	My business has been running at a deficit for a few years. In 2021, I got a loan from NatWest to stay afloat. I have given my share in the family home (50%) as a collateral for this loan. I am now unable to repay it. What should I do? Can the bank repossess my house?	I'm an AI and not a financial advisor, but I can still offer some general advice. If you're unable to repay your loan, it's usually recommended to immediately contact your lender (in this case, NatWest) to discuss your difficulties. Depending on your circumstances, they may be able to suggest different repayment plans or concessions. As for your house, if it was used as collateral to secure the loan, it is indeed possible that the bank can take steps to repossess it in order to recover the debt. However, this is generally seen as a last resort. Banks often prefer to work out a solution with you first before resorting to repossession. Using a property as collateral does increase the risk of it being sold to repay the debt, but there may be options available to you to prevent this. Depending on your circumstances and where you live, you may want to speak with a financial counsellor or legal professional who specializes in debt and bankruptcy solutions. They may be able to discuss strategies like refinancing, debt consolidation, or insolvency procedures that can help protect your assets. These professionals will be familiar with the laws and rules specific to your country or state. Some government organizations offer free financial counselling services, and there may also be legal assistance available. It’s crucial you act as soon as possible and get the professional advice you need. Disclaimer: This advice is intended to be general in nature and should not be relied upon for specific decisions. Always consult with a professional financial or legal advisor who can take into account your specific circumstances.	47.93362379074097	1	"[["" Does the lawyer outline the rules on the distribution of assets in insolvency (s.107 IA 1986 and following)?"", "" Does the lawyer outlines that secured creditors do not share pari passu, but they are paid in priority on the proceeds generated by the sale of secured assets?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the difference between fixed and floating charges?"", "" Does the lawyer clarify that the bank is likely to have a fixed charge over the debtor\u2019s family home?"", "" Does the lawyer clarify that the debtor cannot transfer his equity to their partner to prevent repossession from the bank?"", "" Does the lawyer mention that the security may not be enforceable should the lender not have complied with the rules regulating either their activity as lender or the registration of charges?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]"	3.0	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	24	No|No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q3	My business (a small restaurant in Egham) is saddled with debt towards several suppliers. I do have a loyal customer base, but I feel that I need to reduce my debt burden. My brother offered to buy my business for a fair price, and he also told me he would like to retain me and some of my employees. However, he says that I need to deal with my debt before selling the business to him. I don’t have savings. What can I do?	There are several strategies you might consider to tackle your debt: 1. Debt Consolidation: This involves combining all your debts into one loan with a lower interest rate. You might consider this option, but be aware of the terms and conditions. 2. Negotiations with creditors: You can try to negotiate directly with creditors to get better payment terms or even to reduce your overall debt. 3. Business loan or credit line: If you have good credit, you might be able to get a business loan or open a business credit line to pay off your suppliers. 4. Equity Funding: If you have willing investors, you could sell part of your business in exchange for capital to pay off your debts. This option would dilute your ownership but would allow you to focus on growing the business. 5. Asset liquidation: This involves selling off non-essential assets to raise cash and clear off some of the debt. 6. Cooperative buyout: Another option could be to propose to your brother the idea of a cooperative buyout. This would mean he would purchase the restaurant at a slightly higher price point, with the excess being used to pay off the main part of the debt. You would then stay on in a managerial role and continue to pay off the remaining debt from the income you make. Remember that it's important to seek legal and financial advice before deciding on any of these options to understand the potential legal implications, especially related to insolvency and your debt obligations.	39.1969039440155	1	"[["" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different rescue options available under the Insolvency Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different restructuring options available under the Companies Act 2006?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the pros and cons of each of these options, and provide advice on the most suitable solution?"", "" Does the lawyer suggest the use of a pre-packaged administration procedure?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the changes introduced by the Administration (Restrictions on Disposal etc. to Connected Persons) Regulations 2021"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3]]"	3.0	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q4	I own a pub in Windsor. I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, by additional taxes on alcohol as well as by a reduction in my customer base. I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). I reached an agreement with my bank and with most of my suppliers to delay the repayment of my debt. The HMRC won’t listen and they are threatening legal actions against me. What can I do? HMRC counts for roughly 50% of my unsecured debt (the debt towards the bank is secured by a collateral on my pub).	You can speak to a licensed insolvency practitioner as your current financial situation appears unsustainable. They can provide you with a range of options. One option could be proposing a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to your creditors. A CVA is a form of insolvency that allows you to pay back your creditors over a longer period of time and can be a suitable choice for businesses that are fundamentally viable, but currently in debt. If approved by a majority of 75% of the creditors, the CVA binds all unsecured creditors, including HMRC, whether they voted in favour of the CVA or not. This means that HMRC would have to adhere to it. Once approved, the CVA prevents the HMRC and your other creditors from taking further action against you as long as you stick to the agreed repayment plan. It also freezes all interest and charges on the debts included in the CVA. A CVA isn’t suitable for all businesses, it's important to get advice from a professional before opting for this route. Involving a business rescue expert as early as possible will also maximise the number of options available to you. The expert will be able to detail your next possible steps after an analysis of your current financial situation and potential future cash flows.	30.760697603225708	1	"[["" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different rescue options available under the Insolvency Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different restructuring options available under the Companies Act 2006?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the pros and cons of each of these options, and provide advice on the most suitable solution?"", "" Does the lawyer suggest the use of Part 26A restructuring plans?"", "" Does the lawyer speak of the ability of cramming down dissenting creditors in a Part 26A plan, and the conditions for doing it?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3]]"	3.0	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q5	I have been badly hit by the rise in interest rates on my loans, as well as by a reduction in my customer base (I run a pub in Ascot). I fell in arrears in the payments towards the HMRC, as well as some of my suppliers (but I had to pay in full some of them, as otherwise I would have had to close my business). My landlord is demanding an extortionate amount of money for my rent. While I agreed to a new, 5-year leasing agreement, I realised that I am operating at a loss unless my rent is reduced and the HMRC agrees to a repayment plan. What can I do?	You should take immediate steps to address this situation. 1. Hire a Business Debt Advisor: Seek the expert advice of a business debt adviser who can help you manage your debt and develop strategies to meet your obligations and keep your business running. 2. Contact HMRC: HMRC provides support to businesses in financial difficulty through its Time To Pay (TTP) service. This allows businesses to pay their existing tax in instalments over a period of time. Call the HMRC Payment Support Service to discuss your circumstances. 3. Negotiate with your landlord: Discuss your financial predicament with your landlord. Despite signing a new lease agreement, your landlord may be open to reducing your rent temporarily or restructuring your payment terms in order to keep a tenant. Alternatively, they may allow you to break the lease early without penalty given the circumstances. 4. Cost Cutting: Take a hard look at your business operations. Identify areas where you can cut costs, improve efficiency, and increase profitability. 5. Restructure your Business: If the financial state is very uncertain, you may need to consider business restructuring. This could involve closing unprofitable parts of your business or even declaring bankruptcy. 6. Grow Your Customer Base: Even as you look at your debts and expenses, focus on building your customer base. An increase in customers can contribute to higher revenue and profitability, helping you cover your costs. 7. Refinance your loans: Negotiating a lower interest rate with your lender can significantly help reduce your financial burden. Remember to consult with a financial advisor or an attorney to understand all your options and potential implications. While these suggestions may help, each business situation is unique and may require a different approach or combination of strategies.	52.32684016227722	1	"[["" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different rescue options available under the Insolvency Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer provide an outline of the different restructuring options available under the Companies Act 2006?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the pros and cons of each of these options, and provide advice on the most suitable solution?"", "" Does the lawyer suggest the use of Part 26A restructuring plans?"", "" Does the lawyer speak of the ability of cramming down dissenting creditors in a Part 26A plan, and the conditions for doing it?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3]]"	3.0	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	22	No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q6	I am a real estate developer. Due to the current housing crisis, my mortgages have ballooned, and I am struggling to make money out of the sale of the properties I recently completed. While my housing portfolio is significant, most properties are not yet ready for the market. I am not paying all my suppliers, and the banks are chasing me multiple times per day. If they foreclose, I lose everything. If I complete all my projects, I can repay the banks and the suppliers. However, one of them just filed a petition for winding up my business. I refuse to believe I am insolvent. Is it likely that the petition will be dismissed?	As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or the specific details of your case to make a definitive judgment. However, whether a winding-up petition is dismissed or not heavily depends on the facts of the case and how they’re presented to the court. The court generally considers various factors like whether the company is insolvent, if it can repay its debts as they fall due, if the debt is disputed, the nature and extent of the company's assets, and the rights and interests of the creditors and stakeholders. If indeed you are unable to pay all your creditors and they believe that you can't pay as the debts fall due, you might be seen as insolvent even if you own more assets than you owe. Additionally, if the petition was served correctly and the debt is undisputed, it could be difficult to dismiss the petition. However, if you can prove that you are not insolvent and can repay your debts, you might convince the court to dismiss the petition. In such complex matters, it's very important to take legal advice from professionals who are experienced in these matters. Please consult your attorney and financial advisor for a better analysis.	33.0232515335083	1	"[["" Does the Lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the relevant statutes (ss. 123-124 IA 1986) to determine if a company is insolvent?"", "" Does the law discuss the differences between cash-flow and balance-sheet insolvency?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to s. 122 IA 1986?

Q7	My brother and I have been working together on our hand-made furniture shop for 20+ years. Last year, we had to liquidate the business because we could no longer pay the bills. An official receiver was appointed. Yesterday, he came back to us and asked to repay all the dividends we received in the 5 years before insolvency. This is a ridiculous amount of money (£150,000 each). My brother and I never received a salary. The official receiver says that we could not get any dividends because the business was operating at a loss. We were only paid in dividends to avoid income tax, and because my accountant told me that was fine. Surely, we don’t have to repay that money?	I'm an AI language model and while I'm not a lawyer, I can give you a general sense of how this might play out. When dealing with insolvency and bankruptcy, the actions you took as directors and the financial decisions you made would be looked over, including your decision to pay yourselves in dividends. The UK laws (the Insolvency Act of 1986, for example) can be tough on this. If your company was trading insolvently (meaning it couldn't pay its debts) and you continually took money out of the company in the form of dividends, you could be held personally liable for those amounts if the company goes into liquidation - especially if it's found you were trading while knowing the company was insolvent. However, this is a complex legal matter, with a great deal to lose, so it would be imperative to consult with an attorney who specializes in insolvency. He or she can examine the unique details of your situation and provide advice tailored to your circumstances. Make sure you have all company accounts and relevant information available for them to thoroughly assess your situation.	27.779425621032715	1	"[["" Does the lawyer discuss their client\u2019s role (de jure, de facto or shadow director) within the company?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss directors\u2019 duties with the client?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the relevant rules applicable to directors (ss. 212-213 IA 1986)?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the consequences (e.g. disqualification) arising from the director\u2019s misfeasance?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the Company Director Disqualification Order Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3]]"	6.5	[0, 0, 2.0, 0, 1.5, 0, 3]	25	No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q8	My business went into liquidation last year. I was the owner and director. A liquidator was appointed. He is threatening to sue me for breaching my duties as a director unless I return the money I received as monthly repayments for a loan I gave to my company. He’s also threatening to start a disqualification procedure against me for the same reason. I believe I did nothing wrong – this was a fair loan with interests below the market rate. However, I cannot risk being disqualified, because I am also working as a director in my sister’s company. What can I do? Should I return the money?	I'm an AI and can't provide personal advice, but I can suggest some general actions you might consider: 1. Legal counsel: A legal expert versed in corporate law can provide advice and suggestions tailored to your jurisdiction and unique circumstances. They can describe how loan-back arrangements are viewed under local laws and what your legal responsibilities were as a director. 2. Collect and Review Documentation: Gather all documents regarding the loan and its repayment, including terms, schedules, and executed payments. Share these with your legal counsel to evaluate if there were any breaches of duty. 3. Speak to the Liquidator: Engage in dialogue with the liquidator and clarify their concerns and demands. It's possible some misunderstanding can be resolved, or a compromise can be reached with their help. 4. Professional advice: Financial advisors or business consultants may provide insights into your options, potential outcomes, and strategies. Remember, all perceived threats of legal action should be taken seriously. To avoid further complication, try to refrain from making any decisions or admissions until you've consulted with a legal professional. It's also important not to delay in case timelines for response are in effect. 	33.93606758117676	1	"[["" Does the lawyer discuss their client\u2019s role (de jure, de facto or shadow director) within the company?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss directors\u2019 duties with the client?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the relevant rules applicable to directors (ss. 212-213 IA 1986)?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the consequences (e.g. disqualification) arising from the director\u2019s misfeasance?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the Company Director Disqualification Order Act 1986?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3]]"	3.0	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]	25	No|No|No|No|No|No|Yes|
Q9	My business is operating at a loss. Chase Bank is my major lender, and they have a security over my home. I fell into arrears towards several suppliers, but I do believe I can turn around my business if I am given a bit more time to repay my debts. What can I do?	1. Communication: Get in touch with your suppliers, explain your situation, and work out a new payment plan. Be sure to keep up with this new plan to maintain a good relationship. Additionally, contact Chase Bank and inform them about your situation. They may be able to offer you options such as refinancing, loan modification or forbearance. 2. Business consulting or debt counseling: Get professional help to review your business plan and cash flow, identify areas where you can cut costs, and improve profitability. They can also assist you to enroll for a debt restructuring program if your situation is dire. 3. Legal help: If you are overly burdened with debts and legal actions from creditors are imminent, consider filing for bankruptcy. This is an extreme step, but it can give you time to reorganize and possibly liquidate your business in a controlled manner. 4. Selling assets: If your business owns several valuable assets, you can consider selling some of them to pay off your debt. However, you will have to consider if you can operate your business without these assets. 5. Debt consolidation: This involves combining all your debts into one. This might lower your interest rate, and you only have to worry about one payment. This option depends on the terms and rules of your current loans, so you would need to speak with your lender. However, this is a temporary solution and you need a long-term plan to keep your business profitable. Remember to always get professional advice before making any major decisions like these.	46.724331855773926	1	"[["" Does the lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?

Q10	My business went into liquidation last March. I tried my best to avoid it. I may have preferred some creditors over others, but simply because they knew I was struggling, and they would not give me their products on credit. I may also have taken some money out of the business account to repay the mortgage on my house. Surely, I did nothing wrong? Do I risk anything?	I'm an AI model and not a lawyer but based on information, it seems you might have crossed some legal lines. As a business owner, you have certain legal obligations to your creditors. The act of preferring certain creditors over others could be considered unlawfully discriminatory. Preferential payment in bankruptcy usually involves paying off certain creditors at the expense of others. Also, using business money to repay your personal mortgage during the liquidation process could represent a violation of bankruptcy law. This could be seen as fraudulent conveyance, which occurs when a debtor moves assets to prevent creditors from accessing them during bankruptcy proceedings. You may indeed risk significant liability for these actions. You could be sued for fraudulent conveyance or preferential payment, be personally liable for the business's debts, or face other adverse financial and legal consequences. You should seek advice from a licensed attorney who specializes in bankruptcy law in your jurisdiction as soon as possible. They can provide informed advice and help you navigate the potential legal trouble ahead.	22.206920623779297	1	"[["" Does the lawyer mention the directors\u2019 duties under the Companies Act 2006, ss. 250-277?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss the general remedies available against delinquent directors (ss. 212-214 IA 1986)?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss the risks associated with preferential payments to some creditors (s. 239 IA 1986)?"", "" Does the lawyer outline the consequences (e.g. disqualification) arising from the director\u2019s misfeasance?

Q11	My life-long partner just left me for an Italian scugnizzo who is 15 years younger than her. What’s worse is that before leaving, she emptied our joint business account and she stopped paying the joint mortgage we have on our business. The bank is threatening legal actions against me, and to foreclose on the business property. What can I do? By the way, I cannot contact my (ex) partner but I believe she’s now in Italy with her new partner.	I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. Please remember that while I can provide general guidance, you should definitely seek legal advice from a professional to address your specific situation. Here are some steps you might consider: 1. Consult a lawyer: This is a complicated situation with both personal and business finance issues. An attorney can advise you based on your specific circumstances, local laws, and the nature of your business. Ideally, you should look for a lawyer with experience in matrimonial, international, and business law. 2. Contact your bank: Immediately inform your bank about the situation, and inquire about any possible actions you can take to delay the foreclosure. They may ask you to provide evidence documenting the circumstances. You should also ask them to freeze the business account if it hasn't been completely drained yet. 3. Gather documents: Collect all relevant paperwork such as bank statements, receipts, invoices, and any written agreements you had with your ex-partner. This will help prove that the financial activities were not your doing and that you had no knowledge of her plans. 4. Report to the police: If your partner drained the business account without your consent, this could be treated as theft or fraud. Filing a report would be helpful if you need to take legal action in the future or if her actions endangered the financial stability of your business. 5. Debt advice service: Seek advice from a debt advisory service. They can provide a range of solutions which help with the management of your debts and potentially save your business. 6. International legal actions: If your ex-partner is in Italy, you might need to take actions that involve the international legal system. Some countries have agreements to enforce financial decisions across borders. Your lawyer would be able to advise further on this option. Remember, while this is a very stressful situation, it's important to keep calm and take it step by step. Securing legal advice will be crucial in helping you navigate and potentially resolve this unfortunate situation.	42.54771304130554	1	"[["" Does the Lawyer identify the different forms of liquidation, and the circumstances in which a company can be liquidated?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to the relevant statutes (ss. 123-124 IA 1986) to determine if a company is insolvent?

Q12	After Brexit, I set up a business in the Netherlands. This is a limited liability company. I am the sole director of that company. There are no employees in the Netherlands, just some people I hire occasionally to load and unload the lorries that distribute my products to the rest of Europe. I have now decided to stop selling goods to Europe, because it is not profitable. I want to wind-up the business here in the UK. Can I do it?	As you have formed a limited liability company (BV), in the Netherlands, the winding up and dissolution of the company would be subject to Dutch laws and regulation, not UK laws. Even though you may reside in the UK, the procedures to wind up your Dutch company must be followed according to the Netherlands’ rules. Consult with a Dutch lawyer or with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (Kamer van Koophandel) for guidance on closing your company. You will have to ensure all your tax obligations are settled in the Netherlands, for example, pay any/all outstanding taxes or VAT and comply with Dutch employment laws if applicable. Remember even if you stop doing business, as a director, you have ongoing responsibilities until you officially wind-up or dissolve the company. Consult professionals to make sure you do everything in accordance to the Dutch law.	24.532474517822266	1	"[["" Does the lawyer refer to the relevant laws (European Insolvency Regulation recast (2015); Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations (2005); Brexit Agreements (2020))?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss the difference between COMI and establishment?"", "" Does the lawyer discuss the implications of Brexit for the recognition and enforcement of insolvency judgments?"", "" Does the lawyer refer to any relevant case law?"", "" Does the lawyer provide the correct advice?""], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]"	5.0	[0, 0, 0, 0, 5]	25	No|No|No|No|Yes|
