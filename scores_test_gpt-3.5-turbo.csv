Q1	I have been the director of three companies over the last few years: Motor Racing Limited, Car Racing Limited, and Classic Racing Limited. The first two have gone into liquidation six months ago. Am I allowed to continue trading with the third company?	I am not a lawyer, but I can provide you with some general information. The decision to continue trading with Classic Racing Limited depends on various factors, including the specific circumstances surrounding the liquidation of Motor Racing Limited and Car Racing Limited. If those companies were liquidated due to financial mismanagement, fraudulent activities, or if you were disqualified as a director, it may raise concerns about your ability to continue trading with Classic Racing Limited. However, if the liquidation of Motor Racing Limited and Car Racing Limited was unrelated to any of the above circumstances, you may still be allowed to continue trading with Classic Racing Limited. It is important to consult with a qualified legal professional as they can provide tailored advice based on the specific details of your situation, including the legal and regulatory requirements in your jurisdiction.	2.9553627967834477	1	"[[""Does the lawyer mention that this may be a phoenix company?"", ""Does the lawyer mention Insolvency Act 1986 section 216?""], [3, 3]]"	0	[0, 0]	6	No, the lawyer does not mention anything about this being a potential phoenix company.|No, the lawyer does not mention the Insolvency Act 1986 section 216 in this response.|
